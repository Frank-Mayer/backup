# Backup

[![backup](https://github.com/neovim/backup/actions/workflows/backup.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/neovim/backup/actions/workflows/backup.yml)

This uses [github-backup](https://pypi.org/project/github-backup/) to back up issues, comments, discussions, etc. from the Neovim GitHub.

A Personal access token is expected at `secrets.PAT` to access the GitHub API. Currently a classic token is required.
