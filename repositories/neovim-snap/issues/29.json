    "body": "Could we please release a snap for [Neovim 0.10.0][1]? I'm desperate for the improved clipboard support ðŸ˜…\r\n\r\nI understand that this is probably a more niche distribution with fewer users and that it's hard to maintain many distribution channels. I could be happy to just use another distribution with better support in the release cycle. Would you say that AppImage or another distribution channel receives better support? I like snaps because they're easy to (un)install, run in a semi-containerized environment, and auto-update with rollbacks, so they tend to be pretty reliable.\r\n\r\n## Update\r\n\r\nI tried installing using the tarball and AppImage, but they both complain about the glibc version on my machine. Snap gets around painful dependency issues like these ðŸ˜­ I really don't want to upgrade glibc. It'll cause things to break.\r\n```\r\n(.venv) jalvarado@devrestricted-jalvarado:~/code/spinner-workflows$ nvim\r\n/tmp/.mount_nvimDRSwjJ/usr/bin/nvim: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.28' not found (required by /tmp/.mount_nvimDRSwjJ/usr/bin/nvim)\r\n/tmp/.mount_nvimDRSwjJ/usr/bin/nvim: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /tmp/.mount_nvimDRSwjJ/usr/bin/nvim)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.10.0",
