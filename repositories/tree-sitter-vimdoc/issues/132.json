However, given the vast amount of existing documentation, I think it might be worth thinking about an (old) vimdoc to (new) vimdoc converter.  With that in mind, I'm looking at the existing 'syntax' and asking two questions: a) can the existing material be parsed at all, and b) what would be the best way to support such a tool in a way that minimises the work that a human would need to do?  If that requires a small amount of extra syntax to help the tool, it might be a worthwhile addition.\r\n\r\nUsing `:h buffer-list` as an example, the current syntax doesn't seem to use a single tab as a separator.  The first table in this example uses a 1+ tabs to separate; the second uses a combination of tabs and spaces.  In both cases, the alignment is *visual* (with the exception of the wonky row) rather than syntactical.  \r\n\r\nIt's possible to automate this 'visual' recognition of columns under the condition that the whitespace before an aligned column (if any) must have at least one tab and/or 2+ spaces in it.  Although this reduces false positives, they are still a potential problem: in each case, the question is not whether this can be done, but whether it *should*.  \r\n\r\nIt is necessary to have some sort of clue that tabular layout is intended or, alternatively, that one should *not* be inferred.  A column header is one such clue, but '~' at the end of a line is sometimes used for other purposes.  See, eg., line 616 of windows.txt (\"WinScrolled and WinResized autocommands ~\").  \r\n\r\nI'd also point out that sometimes you might not want a header displayed (as in the third table in 'buffer-list'). This suggests either an invisible header syntax or (my preference) hidden markers to guide the tool.\r\n\r\nCode blocks are a puzzle in terms of how they should fit in a tabular layout.\r\n\r\nSorry for writing too much!",

The fact that it's mixed with visual (space/tab) alignment is one of the worst parts of vimdoc as a markup language.

If they agree on a stricter standardized format for tabular/columnar material that is easier to actually parse instead of just present visually, then we can proceed here.\r\n\r\nThis is a much more intrusive step than adding, say, language markers for codeblocks, which we could do unilaterally. We do **not** want to invent yet another NIH custom format; if we can't do this with vimdoc, we should just switch to Markdown and port doc changes manually (which we increasingly often need to anyway).
