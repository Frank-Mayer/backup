See also https://github.com/neovim/tree-sitter-vimdoc/issues/21 )\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/tree-sitter-vimdoc/pull/16 added `(block)`, but these don't \"nest\".\r\n\r\n_Preamble from https://github.com/vigoux/tree-sitter-vimdoc/issues/12 :_\r\n\r\n> In order for `:help` to render as something other than fixed-width, hard-wrapped text, (e.g. for [HTML format](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html)) the parser needs to give some basic hints about structure besides \"line\". Sometimes (often) the `:help` source needs to be fixed (because it can't be reasonably parsed), but in other common cases it's probably reasonable for tree-sitter-vimdoc to provide some basic idea of:\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example of nested (indented) blocks\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/52e4b779e3df1335efc4774e8dfc199d07e24bfd/runtime/doc/eval.txt#L51-L74\r\n\r\n\"Nested blocks\" simply means blocks of text that have common indentation.  In the following example, \r\n\r\n- we can't parse the `Number 123...` block but if we can at least recognize that it is indented, then the [HTML result](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html) can wrap that block in `<pre>` so that it is readable.\r\n- the `*octal*` line doesn't share indentation so it should be parsed as `(line)` (or possibly introduce a new `(tags_heading)` node?).\r\n- it may be reasonable for us to require blank lines between these blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Number and String types are converted automatically, depending on how they\r\nare used.\r\n\r\nConversion from a Number to a String is by making the ASCII representation of\r\nthe Number.  Examples:\r\n\tNumber 123\t-->\tString \"123\" ~\r\n\tNumber 0\t-->\tString \"0\" ~\r\n\tNumber -1\t-->\tString \"-1\" ~\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*octal*\r\nConversion from a String to a Number is done by converting the first digits to\r\na number.  Hexadecimal \"0xf9\", Octal \"017\" or \"0o17\", and Binary \"0b10\"\r\nnumbers are recognized.  If the String doesn't start with digits, the result\r\nis zero. Examples:\r\n\tString \"456\"\t-->\tNumber 456 ~\r\n\tString \"6bar\"\t-->\tNumber 6 ~\r\n\tString \"foo\"\t-->\tNumber 0 ~\r\n\tString \"0xf1\"\t-->\tNumber 241 ~\r\n\tString \"0100\"\t-->\tNumber 64 ~\r\n\tString \"0o100\"\t-->\tNumber 64 ~\r\n\tString \"0b101\"\t-->\tNumber 5 ~\r\n\tString \"-8\"\t-->\tNumber -8 ~\r\n\tString \"+8\"\t-->\tNumber 0 ~\r\n\r\nTo force conversion from String to Number, add zero to it: >\r\n\t:echo \"0100\" + 0\r\n<\t64 ~\r\n\r\nTo avoid a leading zero to cause octal conversion, or for using a different\r\nbase, use |str2nr()|.\r\n```",
