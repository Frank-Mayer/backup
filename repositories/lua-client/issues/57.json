Nvim core will gain the ability to run Lua code via `nvim -l`.\r\n> 2. We will include some sort of Lua client in Nvim core. Perhaps starting with https://github.com/justinmk/lua-client2\r\n> 3. Legacy lua-client (this repo) will be archived.\r\n\r\nThe goal is for Nvim to be able to spawn child `nvim` processes and then they can be clients of each other using a builtin Lua client which uses Nvim's builtin Lua and msgpack + msgpack-RPC stuff.\r\n\r\n",
