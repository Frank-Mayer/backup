Just my subjective feedback as someone who writes a lot of Lua. \r\n\r\nI also can't see many places in our own runtime where this would be used much. So far `tbl_get` is only used to get fields from LSP capabilities tables, which makes sense.\r\n\r\nAs for namespacing, I think we should introduce `vim.table` and `vim.string` which can live as extensions to the builtin `table` and `string` modules. Later on we can think about how we can coerce these together. Maybe users can opt in to adding `local table = vim.table` to the top of their modules? Then `table.concat` and etc works as normal, but then they also have access to `table.get` (`tbl_get`).",
