It's not about if a server can handle multiple files being opened with `root_dir = nil`.\r\n\r\nSo those with `single_file_support = false` need a workspace folder - and afaik the behavior of lspconfig is that it doesn't start/attach a client at all if there isn't one.\r\n\r\nThat's different from what the reuse client default is about.\r\n\r\n*Edit*:\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to mirror that, `lsp.enable` would need a `requires_workspace: boolean` or something like that. So far we didn't have that concept because `lsp.start` didn't need it as it was kinda implicit - if the user calls it, they'd need to know that the server can handle whatever root_dir/workspaceFolder configuration the user provided. \r\n",

            "body": "> So those with `single_file_support = false` need a workspace folder - and afaik the behavior of lspconfig is that it doesn't start/attach a client at all if there isn't one.\r\n\r\n> If we wanted to mirror that, `lsp.enable` would need a `requires_workspace: boolean` or something like that. So far we didn't have that concept because `lsp.start` didn't need it as it was kinda implicit - if the user calls it, they'd need to know that the server can handle whatever root_dir/workspaceFolder configuration the user provided.\r\n\r\nWould this be something worth supporting in `vim.lsp.enable` (like as a new field in `vim.lsp.Config`)? Personally I'm a user of `single_file_support = false` even for LSPs that support nil rootdirs because, as an example, I don't want to launch clangd when there's no compile_commands.json to mark the rootdir since clangd will inevitably just spit out a bunch of errors.",
