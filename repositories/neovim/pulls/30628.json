A good place for tests would be `test/functional/ex_cmds/` . There is currently no `read_spec.lua` in there, but perhaps could use `test/functional/ex_cmds/write_spec.lua` as a starting point.\r\n\r\nYou can [run a specific test](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/README.md#filter-by-file) like this:\r\n\r\n    TEST_FILE=test/functional/example_spec.lua make functionaltest",
