    "body": "## test(treesitter): add test cases for inspect_tree\r\n\r\nBased on @altermo's work #26944, but modified to use `eq` instead of `Screen:expect` because it's difficult to write tests and debug.\r\n\r\n## feat(treesitter): use 0-based indexing to show ranges in `:InspectTree`\r\n\r\nProblem:\r\n\r\n- `:InspectTree` was showing node ranges in 1-based indexing, i.e., in\r\n  vim cursor position (lnum, col). However, treesitter API adopts\r\n  0-based indexing to represent ranges (Range4). This can often be\r\n  confusing for developers and plugin authors when debugging code\r\n  written with treesiter APIs.\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\n\r\n- Change to 0-based indexing from 1-based indexing to show node ranges\r\n  in `:InspectTree`.\r\n\r\n- Note: To make things not complicated, we do not provide an option or\r\n  keymap to configure which indexing mode to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\n~~Will wait until #26944 is merged first, after which I can rebase again and add test cases for #26944 and #27336 together.~~",

Because the primary representation of Range is 0-based.\r\n\r\nIt could be just a matter of straightforward off-by-one index calculation, but it brings just slightly additional mental effort.\r\n\r\nIf we want to avoid reserving a key for this, I'm also fine with just having it enabled only through API, i.e. `opts` to `vim.treesitter.inspect_tree()`.

I agree with not providing configurable/toggleable options.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to change `:InspectTree` to be always 0-based,  because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n- `:InspectTree` is mostly used for debugging treesitter syntax tree, e.g. when writing queries or do something with the treesitter API.\r\n- In such cases, developers would need to deal with mostly `TSNode:range()` and `vim.api.*` APIs for buffer manipulation, etc., which are all using 0-based indexing.\r\n- Therefore, representing the tree/node range in 0-based index would be less confusing, and it would require less mental effort and save just one additional calculation step while debugging.\r\n- `:InspectTree` would synchronize with the source buffer, whose 1-based line number can be easily read from the window in which the buffer is contained.\r\n- [The upstream tree-sitter playground](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/playground) also shows node ranges in 0-based indexing. Hence more consistency.\r\n\r\nNote: `vim.treesitter.{inspect_tree,show_tree}` was first written in #21322.",
