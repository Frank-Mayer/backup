See https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27274 (cc @wookayin). At this point it seems like we might just have to pick our poison though.\n> \n> I had a branch where I was working on an independent fix for the issues that #27274 resolved, so perhaps I can revive that if @wookayin doesn't want to pick it back up.\n\nMy god this is such a minefield!\n\nIt seems the most glaring problem in that PR is with the metadata table. The metadata table is match level, so regardless of where we go, I would say that it should always be provided with the match table.",
