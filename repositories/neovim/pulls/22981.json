    "body": "There has been a _lot_ of confusion around the new LSP semantic token highlighting. There has been at least one github issue[^1], many reddit posts[^2][^3][^4][^5], and the neovim chat questions with people who wonder why their syntax highlighting changes after a second or so with 0.9. Virtually all of the recommended \"fixes\" for these questions have been \"just disable semantic tokens\" without an explanation or reasoning as to why. It would be a shame for people to disable the feature entirely simply because their colorscheme didn't support LSP tokens when they first upgrade.\r\n\r\nA large part of this confusion is that the default links bypass the `@` groups that many themes have catered for use with treesitter highlighting. When LSP's semantic tokens kick in, they apply a higher priority highlight that reverts back to basic (less expressive) groups, which most modern themes don't style the same. I can't say this is 100% the reason, but it definitely contributes to many people's desire to turn the feature off (\"treesitter highlighting is better, it just gets worse after a second or so!\" is a common theme).\r\n\r\nI understand that the LSP semantic token highlighting and treesitter highlighting are orthogonal, but realistically, they are both there to do one thing--provide a good experience for syntax highlighting in our favorite editor. There's nothing about the `@type` groups that an internal implementation detail couldn't make use of. I agree that from a documentation and recommendation perspective, we shouldn't mix them. They are different. But for the built-in defaults (which are non-exposed implementation details), we can do pretty much whatever we want.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the _default_ links built in to the editor should provide the best out-of-the-box experience. Syntax highlighting (as a general \"feature\"--this includes all forms: syntax, treesitter, and LSP semantic tokens) priority is as follows: Syntax < treesitter < LSP semantic tokens. It makes sense that the link hierarchy should be the reverse: LSP -> treesitter -> syntax. This lets themes opt-in at any level to provide better/more fine tuned highlighting. The bonus is that many themes already have fine tuned treesitter groups, so if LSP semantic tokens kick in, it won't suddenly override all the colors everywhere, which has been a common complaint/source of confusion. For themes that don't color the `@` groups at all, this PR won't change much at all since the links will fall through to the base groups.\r\n\r\n@swarn @mfussenegger @gpanders @clason @lewis6991 \r\n\r\nAs an aside, for the themes that _have_ added support for semantic tokens, they basically just add these links back to the `@` groups. I know `tokyonight`[^6], `catppuccin`[^7] and `kanagawa`[^8] have all needed to add some of these links back (with varying degrees of additional modifier groups they've tweaked).\r\n\r\n[^1]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22956\r\n[^2]: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12g7ijr/treesitter_strange_highlighting_question/\r\n[^3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12g5qk3/neovim_v090_is_very_slow_in/\r\n[^4]: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12fidjh/treesitter_breaks_with_new_neovim_release/\r\n[^5]: https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/12fdlac/neovim_error_after_upgrading_to_090/\r\n[^6]: https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim/blob/main/lua/tokyonight/theme.lua#L256-L264\r\n[^7]: https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim/blob/main/lua/catppuccin/groups/integrations/semantic_tokens.lua\r\n[^8]: https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim/blob/master/lua/kanagawa/highlights/lsp.lua",

I understand the decisions from the previous discussions that led to where we are today.\n\nWe are getting more real world feedback now. There is a _large_ amount of confusion by LSP making highlighting worse due to bypassing the `@` groups.\n\nThe _standard_ LSP groups actually _are_ (standardized!) to be the same thing that the `@` groups are for. I'm only proposing linking these groups that are standardized. Besides, as I said, these default links are implementation details. It makes no difference whatsoever what a server returns for tokens, this change just adds the `@` groups to the highlight chain so themes can opt in at any level to add additional tuning.\n\nIf we use a fallback hierarchy like I propose here, people can be none the wiser and themes can continue to do what they do now.

But for groups without builtin equivalents (`@variable`, `@property`, `@namespace`) this is more meaningful. However, for consistency it makes sense to define all of the semantic token groups to the `@` variants.\r\n\r\nThe change makes sense to me, though I agree with @clason that we should first try and verify that this does address the root issue (either via screenshots showing before/after or individual testers).

            "body": "@jdrouhard Thanks, that's helpful.\r\n\r\nI think there is a growing consensus that the builtin legacy highlight groups that we inherited from Vim are insufficient to support both Tree-sitter and semantic tokens, and attempting to adhere to those groups leads to issues like this. Eventually we will want to deprecate the legacy groups and define a new set of base highlight groups that map to Tree-sitter captures, and to which the semantic token highlights would link to. The legacy groups would then link to the new base groups instead of vice versa. This PR is a good step in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty right now is that (1) those new Tree-sitter groups (such as `@function`, `@comment`, `@namespace`, etc.) are not documented, and (2) are not yet even decided. That effort will also be coupled with development of the new default colorscheme. So this may change again in the future, but seeing as we are early in the 0.10 development cycle this is an acceptable risk.",
