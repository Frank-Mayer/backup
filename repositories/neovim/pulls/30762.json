If we remove the docs, it makes it harder for them to figure out how to act.\r\n\r\nThis is _increasing_ friction for deprecations, not lowering it from a consumer point of view.\r\n\r\nAnd from a maintainer point of view leaving both in has almost no costs. Docs are not coupled to anything else - there is no interaction with other systems that would cause pain (unless the edge case of changing the doc system)\r\n\r\nThe cognitive load of seeing a deprecated function is also not that high - as long as it's clear that the function is documented.",

I have made the point over and over that programmatic compat can be maintained longer, while gaining the rest of the benefits of a deprecation. That is a monotonic gain, there is no (net) cost.\r\n\r\nPlease just avoid reacting and commenting on this until I have the full proposal, which I then hope people will mentally process in full instead of with partial information and assumptions.\r\n\r\n> Have you considered just removing these? If they are not valuable enough to keep ~documentation~ metadata for, then they are not valuable enough to keep. Their implementation may be tiny, but their usage is likely zero (or very close to).\r\n\r\nThe point is that we can avoid making that decision for longer, for more things. That is very high leverage. I don't want to spend time weighing the costs of breaking programmatic compat if I can gain 95% of the benefits without doing that.\r\n\r\nThe particular case that I pointed out is irrelevant. What matters is the general practice that will help us permanently and continually.\r\n\r\n> If you don't want these to appear in completion, then lobby LuaLS to avoid showing deprecated functions in completion.\r\n\r\nI am referring to Nvim cmdline completion also. And I am not going to lobby anyone when I can solve things at the source.",
