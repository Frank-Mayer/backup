Especially with Dictionaries the overhead of the Arena is much lower, as static key names can just be used as such, and are not copied to the arena. Though as a newer complement using typed `dict(foo)` retvals work now for direct lua table construction without needing `lstate` special casing (which still will be worth it in some micro-optimization cases, but for anything regarding options I suspect arena/keydict will be good enough).",
