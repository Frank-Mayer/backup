The crux of your argument is that prepending . to PATH is a perfectly legitimate usecase/workflow, but I've not seen any indications of this.

(Because this `make` bug had affected me plus at least one other person, I thought maybe it would be worth working around so that the \"first Neovim contributor\" experience might be a little smoother).\r\n\r\nNo worries, I understand not wanting to add code that is merely a workaround and not a root cause solution.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind I set out to find the root cause, and I traced it back to a bug in Make 4.3 which stems from their use of the `findprog` function in Gnulib. This was reported to the Make maintainers here:\r\n\r\nhttps://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?57962\r\n\r\nand then forwarded to the Gnulib maintainers here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/coreutils/gnulib/commit/7b1de4a62f8766787160f785217671b074e0f0f2?w=1\r\n\r\nMake 4.4 does not have this bug, and I can confirm that I'm able to run `make` in the Neovim repo with no further modifications to my system than upgrading the version of `make` I'm using to 4.4 or 4.4.1.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nJake Z.\r\n\r\n",

(Because this make bug had affected me plus at least one other person, I thought maybe it would be worth working around so that the \"first Neovim contributor\" experience might be a little smoother).\r\n\r\nMaybe chill? I would like to have the opportunity to ask some questions to clarify things without people packing their bags and deserting. I think with the added context of the make version there was a bug in the commit message/PR description that it's worth having this workaround.",
