Do you think this should be taken into consideration?\r\n\r\nSo this _is_ possible to do, I was able to suspend Nvim immediately after starting it on a debug build on my Mac and some of the terminal responses from queries (e.g. the response to the DECRQM request for synchronized output support) were printed on my shell and not received by Neovim.\r\n\r\nIn a Debug build on my 2021 M1 MBP it takes anywhere from 4-7ms for the TUI to fully initialize.\r\n\r\nHowever, even then the TUI fully initialized correctly and worked. I didn't have all of the features I would have if I hadn't suspended it, but this is not a normal use case -- I pressed `C-Z` as fast as I possible could after running the `nvim` command.\r\n\r\nI think there is an argument to read terminfo only once on startup, but issue the terminal queries (e.g. for kitty keyboard support or sync output) on each resume. This may be useful for some multiplexers which are able to forward these sequences to the parent terminal.",
