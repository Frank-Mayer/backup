But if `NVIM_APPNAME` can be set to an absolute path then that falls apart. Neither Nvim nor plugins can reason about \"the cache directory\" if it's the same directory as \"the config directory\". \r\n\r\n### Other notes:\r\n\r\n- > The new appname check looks for the equivalent of`/../`, \r\n    - Instead of checking for \"..\" literally, can the path be resolved to an unambiguous, absolute path (which is then compared with the umabiguous, absolute form of CWD or its parent)? That should be more robust. Though I don't remember if we have a robust \"normalize\" function internally, yet.\r\n- If this PR ends up being viable then it would need tests, e.g. the [discussion](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/24954#discussioncomment-6870419) mentions `tempname()`.",

The idea behind checking for `..` is that it has to remain a subdirectory of the normal `stdpath('config')` and `stdpath('cache')` etc\r\nI suppose the extension of this logic is to also make sure the appname doesn't start with a path separator, `$HOME/t` would become `/home/user/t` and therefore the initial `/` would throw the error.\r\n\r\n> re \"updated stdpath logic in various places\": for example, `stdpath('config')` and `stdpath('cache')` are currently assumed (correctly) to be separate directories. But if `NVIM_APPNAME` can be set to an absolute path then that falls apart. Neither Nvim nor plugins can reason about \"the cache directory\" if it's the same directory as \"the config directory\".\r\n\r\nAgain, this is not the intention of this pr\r\n\r\n\r\n>  * Instead of checking for \"..\" literally, can the path be resolved to an unambiguous, absolute path (which is then compared with the umabiguous, absolute form of CWD or its parent)? That should be more robust. Though I don't remember if we have a robust \"normalize\" function internally, yet.\r\n\r\nIt was suggested to me that I make use of realpath to check the actual location of the directory. Although this would mean symlinks to strange places would not work and my personal opinion on that is if the user is symlinking they probably have a reason for it (like gnu stow). So my check deliberately stuck to the idea of \"what does the string look like\" not \"where does the resulting directory rest\".\r\nI am of course open to differing opinions from the more wise\r\n\r\n> * If this PR ends up being viable then it would need tests, e.g. the [discussion](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions/24954#discussioncomment-6870419) mentions `tempname()`.\r\n\r\nI shall make sure to add tests. `tempname()` should be the only thing really effected,,I think",
