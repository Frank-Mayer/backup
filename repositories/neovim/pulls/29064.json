The motivation seems to be to just unnecessarily apply the _guildeline_ (not rule) of function as the last argument. And note `rhs` is often not a function. As an example, in my [config](https://github.com/lewis6991/dotfiles/blob/91402eeb8b870f72f22468d4c23654c175b048c7/config/nvim/lua/lewis6991/init.lua#L143-L252), about 50% of my mappings use a string, 50% use opts, and less than 10% use an anonymous function, so this new signature wouldn't improve anything.",
