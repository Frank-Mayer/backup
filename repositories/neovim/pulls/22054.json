From that perspective there is no real difference from \"bundled\" or \"external\" dependencies; they're just dependencies that happen to be in different locations or packaged differently. So I actually agree that this may make reasoning about external dependencies a bit more difficult.\r\n\r\nHowever, I believe we have pretty good safety measures to ensure neovim always works with external dependencies. We already test in our CI if neovim builds correctly with system dependencies on ubuntu. I wouldn't mind adding more CI to tighten up this aspect by also testing if neovim works with non-bundled dependencies on mac or even windows. Testing this is cheap on CI since all dependencies are already pre-built.",
