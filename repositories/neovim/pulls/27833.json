    "body": "(Believe this is the correct place for this PR. Although a runtime file, Vim does not use the `.tutor` extension for its tutor files and thus does not have a `runtime/syntax/tutor.vim` file.)\r\n\r\n1. The colon (:) no longer counted as a keyword character for syntax highlighting. As a result, \"Note:\" now correctly displays as \"**Note**:\", etc. I choose the same set of keyword characters as `runtime/ftplugin/tutor.vim` for consistency. Supposedly the `iskeyword` setting set by that file influences the syntax highlighting, but when building from master, I tripped the \"Tutor applies {unix:…,win:…} transform\" functional test because of this inconsistency. I don't mind the reduncacy, but I am also all for a better fix if one exists.\r\n2. While skimming over the tutor files to confirm item 1, I noticed the *Learning Vim in 2014* link did not extend to the \"2014/\" at the end of the line. The change to the regex I made works identically on links not ending in a \"/\", while allowing matches with the more general `[[:graph:]]` over the more restrictive `\\>` in the character(s) preceding a \"/\". This keeps the regex quite close to the original, including allowing punctuation following a URI to not be matched whether or not the link ends in \"/\", but allows non-keyword characters to be at the end of a link if closed off by a \"/\". An additional functional test has been added to the same file as the test failed in item 1 to confirm this functionality.",

            "body": "Thanks for the PR! Addressing your observations:\r\n\r\n> 1. The colon (:) no longer counted as a keyword character for syntax highlighting.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening here is that syntax/sh.vim is `syn include`d for the `~~~ sh` code blocks within the tutor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, syntax/sh.vim sets `syn iskeyword`, and annoyingly, sets it to a value depending on what shell's installed on the local system. If you have bash installed, it adds a `:` to `syn iskeyword`, which causes matching \"NOTE\" to fail (plus a few other things, like `:set` not being highlighted properly), as it instead matches all of \"NOTE:\". (This is why it's highlighted correctly on the CI, as it doesn't install bash.) Certainly not ideal!\r\n\r\nThere are ways around this by configuring syntax/sh.vim (e.g: `let g:sh_syntax_isk = 0`), but I prefer your approach of setting `syn iskeyword` explicitly.\r\n\r\n> 2. [...] I noticed the Learning Vim in 2014 link did not extend to the \"2014/\" at the end of the line.\r\n\r\nThis is also `&iskeyword` related; namely it doesn't include the digit characters 0-9. Not sure why they're excluded; maybe it's to make moving over lesson numbers within the text a bit easier by requiring just one `w` press? Either way, that behaviour can remain unchanged by setting `syn iskeyword` instead to include `48-57`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I recommend instead setting `syn iskeyword @,-,_,48-57`, and reverting the change to `tutorURL` (that change failed the CI). I'd also recommend moving it near the top of the file, after the `syn include`s.\r\n\r\n(Personally, I'd even be OK with removing the `syn include` for syntax/sh.vim too; the shell examples in the included tutorials are so bare-bones that they receive no highlights from the bundled syntax/sh.vim anyway...)",

I do prefer adding the numerals to `iskeyword` as `@,-,_,48-57` is pretty common throughout the documentation, treats numerals the same as letters when adjacent to keywords, and also is a solution to the second problem, at least as far as its current usage is concerned. URL validation is something with enough edge cases and quirks that I personally do not find regex a particularly appealing solution outside of being a crude approximator, which is all it needs to be here.\r\nI should have caught my own test case error. At one point I accidentally ran the test case with `sudo` which caused it to use my default shell (bash) over my personal shell (zsh) and fail due to how the text was wrapped in the former but truncated in the latter. Lesson: cross-platform, or even cross-shell maintenance can be tricky. A better solution would have been to reformat the tutor file itself so that the offending line did not go beyond 80 characters (considering that, IIRC, the default width of the PowerShell interface and GNOME's terminal emulator is 80).\r\nAs for developing the tree-sitter for such a simple filetype, I *might* be interested in doing it, as a good next step to learning about the technicals of Neovim, although unfortunately it is no where near my highest programming priority right now.",
