Would a simple map for the checkhealth buffer not suffice for the time being for these users?\r\n\r\nTbh I think I'm more confused by this rather than against it, so I don't mind if it gets merged. But it does strike me as odd as I don't really understand the reasoning or what problem is being solved. Is this just about saving time by using `q` instead of `:q`? Or is this about this being a better default or more intuitive somehow?",
