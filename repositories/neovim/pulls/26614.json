This may slow down scrolling and cursor movement in big files with many comment injections (e.g., lsp/_meta/protocol.lua).\r\n\r\nSolution:\r\nIn on_win, collect trees inside the visible range, and use them in on_line.\r\n\r\nNOTE:\r\nThis optimization depends on the correctness of on_win's botline_guess parameter (i.e., it's always greater than or equal to the line numbers passed to on_line). The documentation does not guarantee this, but I have never noticed a problem so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n~~Fixes~~ related https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/5057 (this issue is about a single big block comment, and the current PR is about many single-line comments)",

For example, lines that are edited will be redrawn. Also, `on_bytes` and `on_changedtree` explicitly request redrawing of affected lines with `nvim__buf_redraw_range`. For untouched lines, `on_line` won't be invoked, avoiding unnecessary mark updates, which is why I believe it's better to keep using `on_line`. But I don't know much about the internals of redrawing, so I might be missing something. \r\n\r\n> Hmm this sounds like a bug (or at least sub-optimal impl). later calls to on_line should keep the state of the iterator(s) and not \"revisit\" already handled matches (even in more complex multi-tree situations).\r\n\r\nIIUC this is what the current implementation does. See `state.iter` and `state.next_row`. So far, I have never noticed (with `:Inspect`) duplicate marks for the same node. ",

Also, on_bytes and on_changedtree explicitly request redrawing of affected lines with nvim__buf_redraw_range. For untouched lines, on_line won't be invoked, avoiding unnecessary mark updates, which is why I believe it's better to keep using on_line. \n\nYes, but just because `on_line` is only called for the required lines doesn't necessarily mean it is more efficient since it will incur an additional overhead of being called for each individual line.\n\nRemoving `on_line` might not be the best path forward, but there is still probably some more work we can move to `on_win` to reduce some of the per line overhead.\n\nAt some point I'll try and flamegraph this to see if there's any more low hanging fruit here.\n\n> But I don't know much about the internals of redrawing, so I might be missing something.\n\nThe internal marktree is pretty efficient since it's all low level C. Minimising time spent is Lua and doing more in the marktree _might_ be a beneficial trade-off.\n",
