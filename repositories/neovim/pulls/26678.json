LSP just happens to be the primary provider of those kinds of extmarks.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would make sense to have a separate foldtext function for LSP either, right?\r\n\r\nIf you think this shouldn't be in core though I understand the logic, no worries :)\r\n\r\n  ",

Highly recommend it 👍\r\n\r\nI used it for quite a long time, but in the past few months have had a lot of issues with code automatically folding, random/unpredictable errors and similar. Finally got frustrated so I switched to a modified version of treesitter's foldexpr, which just works with no hassle. I don't really see the point in depending on an additional plugin with ~4500LOC since the changes here (which I use in my own config) make the appearance options of nvim-ufo somewhat redundant. Is there something I'm missing that treesitter folding can't do that nvim-ufo can?",
