You've made a a couple of performance-related PR so it seems it's something you care about. I would personally advice that you make a more targetted approach: identify features with performance problems (or look for issues with the `performance` label) and identify and fix the hot spots for these. I think that would be much more useful, and also make benchmarking easier as you've already identified what to benchmark (the slow feature).",
