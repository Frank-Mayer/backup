So I can 1) make a new `Check` command/function for this use-case, 2) make a generic `Check` command/function to test for any arbitrary condition (or that some command doesn't throw an error), or 3) continue to just use `if has('nvim')` statements and `return`s. What would be your preference?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** It may be a moot point. I changed `'backspace'` to work like `'encoding'` and this greatly reduced the diff in the Vim tests. Hopefully this is a bit more maintainable moving forward.",

My mental model of what's going on with `.` could always be assumed to insert text, and never destroy any text.\r\n\r\nI tried the other backspace settings in vim in the late 90s, but found they were too destructive. I often accidentally backspaced over the first character in my insert and was forced to `<esc>` and undo, but if I deleted exactly the right amount (all of the newly inserted text and no more), then undo undid the previous edit, which was not the intention. Undo became unreliable.\r\n\r\nI went with `backspace=indent` because, at about this same time, vim started adding auto-indention stuff, and I considered that \"adding text\".\r\n\r\nSo why not `backspace=eol`? I'm really used to the idea that every line is kind of an independent space to work on, and they should only be joined or crossed if explicitly intended to do so. `<Enter>` can only add lines, so it's an ok as an explicit action, but `<Backspace>` could delete chars as well, so the compound role of delete AND join left me irked.\r\n\r\nI realize that backspace=2 is very comfortable for people coming from non-vi editors, but by removing this option, you are destroying a part of the original spark of vi. Maybe dinosaurs like myself will all die off if you keep `backspace=2` as the default, but removing it would send neovim in a direction that says to me: \"neovim does not get vi\".\r\n\r\nOne last thing.. thanks for doing that survey. I would have been very sad to find this gone, and going back to vim is an option I would have dreaded.",

All that means is that instead of \r\n```vim\r\nset backspace=1\r\n```\r\nyou'd have to use\r\n```vim\r\nset backspace=indent,eol\r\n```\r\nin your config.
