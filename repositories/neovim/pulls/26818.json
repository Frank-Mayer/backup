This will make mistakes and errors at least\r\n  *recognizable* while generating a release note during release\r\n  (which should, however, be manually fixed by the release manager).\r\n  NOTE: This changes will also result in new \"vim-patch\" section.\r\n\r\n- Include \"ci\" groups which were previously missing.\r\n",

If there is a general expectation that PR titles of _autogenerated_ PR:s (such as backport PR:s) are good to use, then I think we should not prepend `[Backport release-0.9]` to such PR titles in the first place, and instead make them standout in some other way (like screaming label colors). but such PR:s get merged very quickly, so there might be no problem with cluttering the open PR view in the first place. Even if PR titles are not validated in general I understand the expectation that auto-generated messages are good, because why would we have generated a bad message and not a good message",

We should make all the commits merged to HEAD (`master`) and backport release branches follow the correct commit message format -- as much as possible. However, unless everything is automated and *strictly* enforced, there still might be some exceptions or human mistakes happen. Devs often make use of Github's feature to \"edit the commit message\" while merging PRs through web UI (to correct typos or fix commit messages at ease), I'm a bit against too-strict enforcement. Nevertheless, we can consider further improvements to the PR backport automation (e.g. do not have the \"[backport release]\" prefix, but making it as a suffix, etc.).\r\n\r\nA minor remark:\r\n\r\nSome other kind of exceptions --- #26800 (by @zeertzjq) also draws my attention because it cherry-picks two commits from deps/libtermkey that violate the intended commit message format. It's debatable whether we want these two commits ( b4ef9134007aeab421d93299bdf3b97fba0ffa79, ffe96c6c1c6c54bc03f2d534c9a6bf92c2dd1e51) include in the release note, and whether these would be manually edited for the release note during the release process. However, I think being aware of some malformed commit messages would be still beneficial because otherwise `git cliff` will not generate any warnings or notifications.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>git cliff --config scripts/cliff.toml HEAD~5..HEAD</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\r\n\r\n## [unreleased]\r\n\r\n### (unclassified; TODO: review manually)\r\n- Ignore key_mouse unless it is exactly \\e[M because some terminfos relate to different encoding modes (thanks Ninji)\r\n- Handle mouse buttons 6/7 (often used for horizontal scrolling)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- **build**: Do not drop commits with malformed messages in release note\r\n\r\n\r\n### Refactor\r\n- **tui**: Remove code that is no longer necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- **functional**: Remove faulty pending check\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",

Automation and less manual jobs are of course good, but I think we should aim for correctness too.\r\n\r\n> The purpose of cliff + conventional commits is to reduce the work involved in producing release notes.\r\n\r\nIf we want *full* automation while ensuring correctness (i.e., not unawarely missing any commits), we probably would need have better enforcement. Because of many possible reasons and the current limitation of Github UI/UX, conventional commits are not strictly enforced; (1) a maintainer can change title (on squashing merge) even if lintcommit has passed, and might make some mistakes; (2) commits in PR passed CI but the \"title of a PR\" had a mistake so the merged commit ended up violating conventional-commit (e.g. 4ee656e4f35766bef4e27c5afbfa8e3d8d74a76c and #26807); to name a few. Indeed, for upcoming v0.10 release (between v0.9.0..HEAD), there are already a few commits that violate the commit message format. However, we probably don't want to make the process of merging PR unnecessarily complicated. Errors can happen and are often fine.\r\n\r\nIf we want to get rid of any manual process in writing the git-cliff-generated release note, we could just have a *\"uncategorized\"* or \"others\" section collecting all the unclassified (incorrectly-formatted) commits instead of manually editing the release note (which, however, shouldn't take too much time, to delete or move around only a few lines).",

I've made a few additional changes so now the \"uncategorized\" section would come at the end. The new sections are vim patches (not sure we want to include this or not because it's quite messy and looooong) and this uncategorized section; if one removes these two these should be equivalent (except for other changes regarding \"[backport release]\").\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can see around 5 minor commits as well as `version.c: Update` commits (`git cliff --config scripts/cliff.toml v0.9.0..HEAD`). BTW there is [another issue](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/423) as a side effect but hope this can be addressed by upstream (git-cliff) fix.",
