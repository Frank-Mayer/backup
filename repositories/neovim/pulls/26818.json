The risk is that we would just pile on more exceptions, instead of making sure to actually follow the intentional format in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo, specifically about backports.  If there is a general expectation that PR titles of _autogenerated_ PR:s (such as backport PR:s) are good to use, then I think we should not prepend `[Backport release-0.9]` to such PR titles in the first place, and instead make them standout in some other way (like screaming label colors). but such PR:s get merged very quickly, so there might be no problem with cluttering the open PR view in the first place. Even if PR titles are not validated in general I understand the expectation that auto-generated messages are good, because why would we have generated a bad message and not a good message",

We should make all the commits merged to HEAD (`master`) and backport release branches follow the correct commit message format -- as much as possible. However, unless everything is automated and *strictly* enforced, there still might be some exceptions or human mistakes happen. Devs often make use of Github's feature to \"edit the commit message\" while merging PRs through web UI (to correct typos or fix commit messages at ease), I'm a bit against too-strict enforcement. Nevertheless, we can consider further improvements to the PR backport automation (e.g. do not have the \"[backport release]\" prefix, but making it as a suffix, etc.).\r\n\r\nA minor remark:\r\n\r\nSome other kind of exceptions --- #26800 (by @zeertzjq) also draws my attention because it cherry-picks two commits from deps/libtermkey that violate the intended commit message format. It's debatable whether we want these two commits ( b4ef9134007aeab421d93299bdf3b97fba0ffa79, ffe96c6c1c6c54bc03f2d534c9a6bf92c2dd1e51) include in the release note, and whether these would be manually edited for the release note during the release process. However, I think being aware of some malformed commit messages would be still beneficial because otherwise `git cliff` will not generate any warnings or notifications.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>git cliff --config scripts/cliff.toml HEAD~5..HEAD</summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\r\n\r\n## [unreleased]\r\n\r\n### (unclassified; TODO: review manually)\r\n- Ignore key_mouse unless it is exactly \\e[M because some terminfos relate to different encoding modes (thanks Ninji)\r\n- Handle mouse buttons 6/7 (often used for horizontal scrolling)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n- **build**: Do not drop commits with malformed messages in release note\r\n\r\n\r\n### Refactor\r\n- **tui**: Remove code that is no longer necessary\r\n\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- **functional**: Remove faulty pending check\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>",
