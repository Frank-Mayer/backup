(Rule of thumb: if we can't test it, we can't support it. It's hard enough keeping everything working on the platforms we currently support, with all their local idiosyncrasies.)\r\n\r\nSuch adaptations are the distribution's job, so if building yourself is not an option, you should bring this up with them (adding the caveat that Neovim does not support building against LuaJIT2, and any issues that arise from that are their problem).",

Lua is supposed to be the fallback in cases where luajit isn't available.\n\nEven supporting just lua and luajit can be time consuming with a bunch of nasty edge cases, and adding luajit2 on top of this doesn't sound fun.\n\nThat said I think this can be solved without our involvment. I don't see a reason why distributions can't opt to choose luajit2 instead of lua on big endian systems. We have (for better or worse) zero control how distributions choose to build neovim. If you suggest this to the neovim package maintainer for a distro and they agree with you then that should solve your problem IMO.",

Should that be the case when following the default neovim build instructions when PUC lua is the default? Because of this I thought we need luajit. Nevertheless I played around with some modern package managers like lazy.nvim or packer.nvim and it seems that they require luajit. Are there also plugins right now (or in the future) that require luajit? This just seemed to me that we're not really future proof by just using PUC lua.\r\n\r\nYes, we can also ask the Linux distributions (Suse, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Fedora) to build neovim with luajit2 for us but this is a lot of effort and hard to handle. \r\n",

Should that be the case when following the default neovim build instructions when PUC lua is the default?\n\nLuajit is the default, not PUC lua. PUC lua is meant as a fallback/replacement when luajit can't be used. If you mean that PUC lua should be chosen by default on s390x then I guess that's a fair point.\n\n> Nevertheless I played around with some modern package managers like lazy.nvim or packer.nvim and it seems that they require luajit.\n\nI'm fairly sure packer.nvim does not require luajit. What makes you think it does?\n\n> Are there also plugins right now (or in the future) that require luajit?\n\nIt looks like anything by folke will require luajit. Other than that a luajit requirement is rare. We don't govern how plugins are developed so I can't tell you how future plugins will be like.\n\n> This just seemed to me that we're not really future proof by just using PUC lua.\n\nI don't understand what you mean. A single plugin author decided to have luajit as a requirement for their plugins. How can we possibly draw meaningful conclusions from this?\n\n> Yes, we can also ask the Linux distributions (Suse, Red Hat, Ubuntu, Fedora) to build neovim with luajit2 for us but this is a lot of effort and hard to handle.\n\nI asked so *I* could contact the relevant distribution. If you and your team really use 5 different linux distros then I guess that's out of the question regardless.\n\nI think this issue is at the end of the road and that there's not much we can do. You should already be able to download neovim on s390x with your distros package manager, although with PUC lua. Most plugins will work just fine with that. If that's not sufficient then we've already provided a way for you to manually install neovim with luajit2. Why are these workarounds not sufficient?",
