With this change I get a (somewhat concerning for a beginner user) that a soon-to-be-removed function is being used whenever I request completions. Whenever this has happened in the past I've been eager to contribute the update to the plugin (e.g. when all of the `health.report_X` functions got replaced by `vim.health.X`) but in this case plugins are being told not to use something anymore yet we don't have a suitable replacement yet, so I cannot do that.\r\n\r\nBecause of this I'm leaning towards following [our guidelines](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3a3e0251267a99eec6cfb2a058f9e992d01107fd/MAINTAIN.md#deprecating-and-removing-features) and softly deprecating these APIs until we have a public replacement.",

If the server uses `defaultItems` and once we start supporting it and opt-in to the capability, you likely can't use it anymore anyway.\r\n\r\n`text_document_completion_list_to_complete_items` won't see a replacement (at the same level) either, because exposing a public API at that level is just too constraining and hinders us from improving the built-in functionality. It even gets in the way of addressing bugs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way `parse_snippet` was/is used is questionable, and I'd like a longer discussion before we expose something similar.\r\nIt turns a snippet simply into text, which defeats the main point of using snippets.\r\n\r\nFor example, in c++ with clangd if you type `std::th` you get the candidates:\r\n\r\n- `this_thread`\r\n- `thread`\r\n- `throw_with_nested(Tp && t)`\r\n\r\nThe last one is a snippet that looks like `throw_with_nested(${1:Tp &&t})`\r\n\r\nIf you select that, you end up with `throw_with_nested(Tp &&tt)|` with the cursor at the end, and then you have to backtrack to edit the argument. The user experience would probably be better to just insert `throw_with_nested` instead, to not interrupt the typing flow. Or give the option to expand the snippet properly via `vim.snippet.expand` (which is kinda the plan)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we can _consider_ is to expose a `parse` function that returns the AST. That would let plugin authors do whatever they want, including applying transformations and stuff like that. But I wouldn't do that yet, but only after we've used it in anger for a bit and are confident it will stay as it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Because of this I'm leaning towards following our guidelines and softly deprecating these APIs until we have a public replacement.\r\n\r\nI've been advocating for this soft-deprecation in other places, (Like with `get_active_clients()`, which has a huge reach). In this case I opted to fast track it, because the functions are more niche (targeting only completion), and I don't want to drag this out longer than necessary.\r\n\r\n> With this change I get a (somewhat concerning for a beginner user) that a soon-to-be-removed function is being used whenever I request completions.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we want to target beginners with nightly builds.\r\n",

I agree that this function shouldn't be used as the snippet text to insert and instead `vim.snippet.expand` should be used in that case, but having to parse the snippet AST to define the completion word feels a tad inefficient, and in those cases the \"dummy logic\" of just returning a string representation of the snippet feels appropriate.\r\n\r\n> This. We need to allow ourselves to make radical breaking changes during the development cycle, if it's clear that it's a temporary situation that will be resolved (with a better state of things) before the next release.\r\n\r\n@clason fair. I don't want us to slow down, but IMO suddenly deprecating (with a noticeable user impact) a function that doesn't have a suitable replacement yet feels a bit off. After all we're still using `parse_snippet`, so we don't know how to address the deprecation either.",
