The PR description sounds like an unambiguous win to me.\n> \n> I wouldn't mind adapting the tests instead of adding a hack around them.\n\nWe could, but would need to adjust the commit/PR description since I currently just skip doing full casefolding for sharp s and turkish i because the tests fail. I'm pretty sure there's a bug in the regexp code but I haven't had the time to figure out exactly what's happening. We have two options I believe:\n\n- Adjust commit/PR message and merge. This would entail full casefolding for all characters except for the two I mentioned with the intention of fixing these later on.\n\n- Adapt/yeet the tests that cause a problem. Note that I'm fairly sure there is an actual bug since the regex engines behaves differently.",
