The  issues here, such as they are, are\r\n\r\n1. Historical: the OG Lua annotations are [EmmyLua](https://emmylua.github.io/annotations/param.html), which don't contain spaces.\r\n2. Practical: LuaLS is _the_ tool we use for type checking, so it does play a prominent role in our developer guide and setup (`.luacheckrc`), and also defaults to no spaces -- which means that auto-generated docs also contain no spaces, adding (minor) friction when having to massage them manually (based on PR comments).\r\n\r\nNone of these are a blocker and only mentioned for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this should be automated, ideally using StyLua (which should be powerful enough to do this).",
