I've left the skeleton of the testing there, if someone would like to pick it up or explain how I would go about testing this module, I'd be thrilled. I've tried a few different ways, based on what other runtime modules like secure and editorconfig do, but I just don't understand busted well enough and the how, when, and why of Neovim functional testing (also probably doesn't help that I'm not a dev). Rather than just give up completely, I thought I'd just throw this up here if someone wants to take it over instead of walking me through it that's totally fine!",
