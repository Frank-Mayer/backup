    "body": "Allows injection ranges to span quantified node captures. I had made this PR mostly for the sake of convenience but I have also noticed it's made injections more robust in certain ways:\r\n\r\n- Empty injection ranges are ignored (see the modification in `parser_spec`; previously, the ranges were not counted before because they were empty, so I had to change the offset amount)\r\n- Most use cases for `injection.combined` are now obsolete\r\n  - The only cases where it would still be necessary (that I can think of) are when you really need a combined injection range and you cannot capture both nodes for that combination in just a single query.\r\n- Combined injection ranges span the in-between area more accurately. See the below images:\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n![beforeinjection](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/55766287/f9f8e90c-96a6-493c-8554-881646276326)\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n![afterinjection](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/55766287/6b618f6c-b844-491f-a31f-70b10bb1fbeb)\r\n\r\n**Question:** Was the previous behavior intended? Perhaps there are cases where parsing the content in-between the combined range (rather than just combining the nodes themselves and parsing only those) leads to undesirable highlighting? I couldn't find an answer to that question from the documentation, but it is very specific. Perhaps a reviewer wiser than myself can answer it\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI will add tests later, if this PR is deemed acceptable",

            "body": "Ok, some more thoughts. Currently, `injection.combined` is pretty buggy. If I wanted to have the following type of injection:\r\n```scheme\r\n(arguments\r\n  (string\r\n    (string_content) @injection.content)\r\n  (#set! injection.combined)\r\n  (#set! injection.language \"c\"))\r\n```\r\nthe entire injection has the same range, leading to highlights bleeding into other areas, which is undesirable. See the following image:\r\n\r\n![buggyinjection](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/55766287/32ba480c-648a-46ee-b85a-c84a66ccbbdb)\r\n\r\nHowever, as this PR stands now, there is no easy way to achieve injection ranges for the above. #27504 would help, but it would still only be giving an ugly way to solve this problem (we would have to calculate an offset for everything, and this can be bad because who knows if, e.g. the strings above will or will not have a trailing comma?). In my opinion, the proper way forward would be to use quantified captures in place of what `injection.combined` used to be needed for, and keep `injection.combined` for special cases.\r\n\r\nSpecial cases would apply to, e.g., the `html_tag` injection shown in the PR description. In the `lua` arguments example, we don't want to inject the range in-between each node, since that would mean the string delimiters and trailing commas also get injected. However, we do want the text in-between to be part of the injection for the HTML tags in Markdown, because then we get a nice highlight for the text inside the tags (which doesn't exist now).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** I would like to propose a new meaning for `injection.combined`. For\r\n\r\n```\r\nother NODETYPE other\r\nother NODETYPE other\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe query\r\n\r\n```scheme\r\n(NODETYPE)+ @injection.content\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould inject:\r\n\r\n```\r\nother ******** other\r\nother ******** other\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```scheme\r\n((NODETYPE)+ @injection.content (#set! injection.combined))\r\n```\r\nshould inject:\r\n\r\n```\r\nother **************\r\n************** other\r\n```\r\n\r\n@clason @justinmk @lewis6991 does this sound like an acceptable change?",
