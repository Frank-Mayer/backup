            "body": "@justinmk I might understand your point, suggesting that options like `silent` are meant for specific use cases and could become a maintenance burden. I somewhat agree with this perspective.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current API does have some issues, such as:\r\n\r\n* Functionally, for `hover` requests, there's typically only one effective result. But if multiple LSP servers supporting `hover` are activated, the notification continues even after one result is obtained due to the presence of additional servers. I understand it's impossible to avoid this issue with the current implementation, but then the message becomes not just wrong but also annoying.\r\n* From an API design perspective, while `code actions` and `hover` might notify when there are no valid results, other requests using `location_handler` (especially `references`) do not notify when there is no result. In fact, compared to hover, `references` might need this notification more as it, like `code actions`, returns multiple results. For hover, typically only one result is meaningful.\r\n* Regarding the code for this part, it indeed needs some cleaning or refactoring. For instance, this PR attempts to fix the unused `silent` implementation.\r\n\r\nGiven these issues, I think we could at least write a generic handler to manage these notifications, and I might try to implement this. What do you think?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I don't quite agree with the approach @mfussenegger suggested. While using `:silent` is a great for VimScript, it seems rather odd for Lua functions. Many might choose to directly call these functions in Lua (like in an external Lua function), and backing to VimScript invoking a Lua function again just for `:silent` is both odd and cumbersome. Implementing an equivalent mechanism within Lua seems the best way to approach this, such as configuring `vim.notify,` but this would have significant implications.`",
