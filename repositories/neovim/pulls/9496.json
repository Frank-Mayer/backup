    "body": "More of TODO than WIP to be honest, but at least \"conceptual\" preview of something that can become a generalization of virttext, where virtual text also can be placed in the middle of a line an not only at the end. When working on #9492 I finally understood the remaining missing pieces how horizontal cursor movement/tracking works with conceal, and general virttext can be understood as the the inverse of conceal: we shift vcols to the right rather than the left on the screen. \r\n\r\nThis currently hard codes some virtual text at line 3 column 10. `h` `l` etc cursor movement and mouse clicks should be handled properly. Proper implementation would really need tracking of horizontal changes to marks, so further work will be scheduled after the initial extmark merge #5031.\r\n\r\nAlso an open question is how to deal with extra needed vertical space. Should virttext be truncated, or should the line be allowed to grow vertically due to virtual text? The later sounds more ideal, though this will differ with conceal behaviour, and might break some invariants.\r\n\r\nOne could even go so far and allow vcols to change, though that could be a larger and more risky endeavour. But on the other hand flexible vcols might be something we want anyway, so the text rendering of an external UI can affect what `gj` and `gk` does, and not only vim's hard coded calculation for how much space text should take on screen.",

Setting `concealcursor` for conceals having an effect on \"`concealcursor`\" for inlaying might not be desired. Concealing vs Inlaying seems the main use case split for applying a generalized conceal implementation that could be reused/instantiated in either case, and where virtualtext is possibly just part of Inlaying.\r\n\r\nIdeally, there would be a single generalized conceal feature, whose \"conceals\" could be grouped (inlaying, virttext, conceal, ...), and could be configured (`concealcursor`, etc) by group.",

For this to work, we have to consider what's reasonable to have _while moving the cursor_, no just its static position. To have a simpler model of that, we should stop viewing the text as 2D, and model it simply as 1D (a long string with a lot of `\\n` in the middle). Given that, we can now simply think of any cursor motion as either going forward or back in the file (right or left in the long string it is), even though while editing we in fact use two dimensions, underneath it's not.\r\n\r\nNow consider in the following diagram, the line above is the text _displayed_ (containing a mix of `virtual` and `REAL` content), while the line below is just the corresponding `REAL` text content, `|` is the current cursor position and `⇒` separates the whole text states in each step:\r\n\r\n1. In `ABxyGH`, `xy` conceals `CDEF` (shorter virtual text hides larger real one):\r\n    ```\r\n    Warp from left:\r\n\r\n     |ABxyGH ⇒ A|BxyGH ⇒ AB|xyGH ⇒ ABx|yGH ⇒ ABx|yGH ⇒ ABx|yGH ⇒ ABxy|GH ⇒ ABxyG|H ⇒ ABxyGH|\r\n    |ABCDEFGH⇒A|BCDEFGH⇒AB|CDEFGH⇒ABC|DEFGH⇒ABCD|EFGH⇒ABCDE|FGH⇒ABCDEF|GH⇒ABCDEFG|H⇒ABCDEFGH|\r\n\r\n    Warp from right:\r\n\r\n     ABxyGH| ⇒ ABxyG|H ⇒ ABxy|GH ⇒ ABx|yGH ⇒ AB|xyGH ⇒ AB|xyGH ⇒ AB|xyGH ⇒ A|BxyGH ⇒ |ABxyGH\r\n    ABCDEFGH|⇒ABCDEFG|H⇒ABCDEF|GH⇒ABCDE|FGH⇒ABCD|EFGH⇒ABC|DEFGH⇒AB|CDEFGH⇒A|BCDEFGH⇒|ABCDEFGH\r\n    ```\r\n   An extreme case would have an empty string in place of `xy`, in which case, when the cursor travels through the \"invisible tunnel\", it would get stuck for a while to go either from `B` to `G` or from `G` to `B` (while it's jumping the real chars behind). It's the use case of conceal.\r\n2. In `ABwxyzEF`, `wxyz` conceals `CD` (larger virtual text hides shorter real one):\r\n    ```\r\n    Warp from left:\r\n\r\n   |ABwxyzEF⇒A|BwxyzEF⇒AB|wxyzEF⇒ABw|xyzEF⇒ABwxyz|EF⇒ABwxyzE|F⇒ABwxyzEF|\r\n     |ABCDEF ⇒ A|BCDEF ⇒ AB|CDEF ⇒ ABC|DEF ⇒ ABCD|EF ⇒ ABCDE|F ⇒ ABCDEF|\r\n\r\n    Warp from right:\r\n\r\n    ABwxyzEF|⇒ABwxyzE|F⇒ABwxyz|EF⇒ABwxy|zEF⇒ABwx|yzEF⇒A|BwxyzEF⇒|ABwxyzEF\r\n     ABCDEF| ⇒ ABCDE|F ⇒ ABCD|EF ⇒ ABC|DEF ⇒ AB|CDEF ⇒ A|BCDEF ⇒ |ABCDEF\r\n    ```\r\n    An extreme case would have a zero-length match instead of `CD`, in which case, the cursor travels through the \"discontinuity\", it would jump over from either `B` to `E` or from `E` to `B`, as there's no real text between it, only virtual. It's the use case of inlay hints (and virtual text, at the end of the line).",

As a result, the ability to conceal text -- for example, [links in Markdown documents](https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown/issues/347) -- isn't actually all that helpful in improving legibility, because you end up with weird, ugly, jagged, short (or empty) lines.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if anticonceal could offer a solution to this? If so, that would be huge for me. I love Neovim and use it whenever I can, but I still tend to use Emacs for Markdown and Org documents (Emacs wraps concealed text correctly).",

It's the use case of inlay hints (and virtual text, at the end of the line).\r\n\r\nAfter #20130 is merged, NeoVim has got Vim's solution for inlay hints. Right after first usages I'm spotting usability issues that relate to the quote above. Movement over a buffer with intermixed virtual text is affected by it, using `w` to jump over words, for example, often may land at the start of a virtual text that comes before the start of the real text, the text that's going to be changed on `cw` is far from cursor, after the virtual head. One can't edit virtual text, just the real text, so why the cursor jumps to the virtual text instead of the actual text? It's an implementation detail that's affecting editing in counter-intuitive ways.\r\n\r\nIdeally, while editing code, virtual text would be passed-through, popping in and out of existence meanwhile real content changes. If that's not attained, then we have what we have now, virtual text confusingly positing as real text.",

I'm not sure I understand the significance of the distinction or what this means exactly. At a high level, why does it make sense to think about virtual text occupying horizontal space in terms of the conceal feature / as \"anti-conceal\"? There's some mention of this benefiting from existing features / offering a more consistent experience - what does that look like concretely?\r\n\r\n- Would virtual text occupying horizontal space be allowed to contain newlines? For example, given\r\n```\r\ndef foo(|)\r\n```\r\nwhere `|` is the cursor, one might want to virtually display a completion as\r\n```\r\ndef foo(|\r\n  arg1,\r\n  arg2,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nwhere the lines with `arg1,` and `arg2,` appear as virtual text but the closing `)` does not, and this would all still be only one actual line.",
