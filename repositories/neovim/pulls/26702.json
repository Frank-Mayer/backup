You can run the latest nvim with it. The added benefit is that it gives you also a dev environment with `nix develop ./contrib` (or `nix develop 'github:neovim/neovim?dir=contrib` if you haven't cloned it yet). Ofc the build breaks may break when we update dependencies but that's part of the deal: it's best effort, no new pipelines etc.\r\n\r\nI understand if the team wants to remove it since it's not a core aspect of neovim but I guess nix builds makes for the most reproducible builds, making debugging easier. I use the `nix develop` to develop on neovim (less recently) but there are other users. \r\nI feel like it is low maintainance (@dundargoc let me know if you disagree), just let me deal with those PRs.

In that regard \r\n\r\nThe advantage of having the flake directly in the nix repo is that you reference commits directly:\r\n`nix run 'github:neovim/neovim?dir=contrib&rev=242261d4e77806cdb4559c2be58613113a393a4e'`\r\n(or not `nix run 'github:neovim/neovim?dir=contrib` gets latest version). \r\nBut the other aspect I find interesting as well is for development. The flake can get you a development environment with all the dependencies in a manner I find sexier than other approaches (you are in your shell, not a docker image etc). The flake provides differents targets so it can configure the build system with asan, debug symbols etc. \r\n \r\nMy perception is that it doesn't impact the neovim team much since the nix fixes are brought by nix users. Several reports from the nix users have allowed to detect problems with the build system that would  have happened on any distrib.\r\nIf it's a bother to the team let's take the flake down like we took down the deb build, I understand it's not at the core of neovim business.",

And bumping the commits daily or even weekly would not be allowed for nixpkgs but this could be done in another repository.it would be sad to lose the ability to build arbitrary neovim commits via the nix cli only (one would need a wrapper script to build in \"pure\"/reproducible mode)",
