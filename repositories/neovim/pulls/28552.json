I had a solution for this for a long time and can customize it the way I like independent of the decision here.\r\n\r\nI brought up the `auto` severity because of the decision to add a default keymap, and I felt that this behavior would make for a more useful default for the typical user. It's the keymap I would've recommended others to setup because my assumption is that the the usual workflow is to fix errors before warnings before information. Hence a keymap to go to the next thing that needs fixing.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised about the backlash and outside of your example, I still can't comprehend why anyone wouldn't fix errors before warnings. I have lots of cases where I temporarily introduce warnings while iterating on something and just want to ignore them until I'm done getting it working. Am I really that off with this, and that's unusual?\r\n\r\n\r\nSuggestion: Keep this PR open for a couple of days to see what kind of reactions it gets?\r\n",
