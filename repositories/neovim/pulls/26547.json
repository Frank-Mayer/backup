(Nvim\n+  supports Vimscript version 1 _only_.) Be aware that patches labelled `Vim9:`\n+  may still contain applicable fixes to other parts of the codebase, so these\n+  patch need to be checked individually.\n+- Updates to `testdir/Makefile` are usually NA because the Makefile implicitly\n+  finds\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/8a677f8a4bff6005fa39f090c14e970c3dfdbe6e#diff-b3c6ad6680a25a1b42095879e3a87104R52\n+  all `test_*.vim` files.\n+- Compiler warning fixes: Nvim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a\n+  very different build system from Vim.\n+    - Note: Coverity fixes in Vim are relevant to Nvim.\n+- `*.proto` changes: Nvim autogenerates function prototypes\n+- #ifdef tweaking: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all\n+  platforms - but Nvim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't\n+  relevant to Nvim.\n+- Legacy system support: Fixes for legacy systems such as Amiga, OS/2 Xenix,\n+  Mac OS 9, Windows older than XP SP2, are not needed because they are not\n+  supported by Nvim.\n+    - NA files: src/Make_, src/testdir/Make__\n+- if_*.c changes: `if_python.c` et. al. were removed.\n+- term.c changes: the Nvim TUI uses libtermkey to read terminal sequences;\n+  Vim's `term.c` was removed.\n+- `job` patches: incompatible API and implementation\n+    - NA files: src/channel_, src/job_, src/testdir/test_channel_,\n+      src/testdir/test_job_\n+- `:terminal` patches that modify NA files: incompatible API and\n+  implementation\n+    - NA files: src/terminal_, src/testdir/test_terminal_\n+- `defaults.vim` patches\n+- Most GUI-related changes: Nvim GUIs are implemented external to the core C\n+  codebase.\n+    - NA files: src/gui_, src/gvim_, src/GvimExt/, src/testdir/test_gui*\n+- `balloon` changes: Nvi does not support balloon feature\n+    - NA files: src/beval_, src/testdir/test_balloon_\n+- libvterm changes: Nvim does not vendor libvterm in `src/`.\n+- Screendump tests from `test_popupwin.vim`, `test_popupwin_textprop.vim`:\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12741#issuecomment-704677141\n+- json changes: incompatible API https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/4131\n+    - NA files: src/json*, src/testdir/test_json.vim\n+- `test_restricted.vim` restricted mode is removed in\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11996\n+- Many tests in `test_prompt_buffer.vim` require incompatible Vim features\n+  such as `channel`; they should still be included, but skipped\n+- non-runtime documentation: Moved to https://neovim.io/doc/,\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki#developers\n+    - NA files: Filelist, README, INSTALL*,\n+- Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an\n+  issue if you aren't sure.\n+\n+==============================================================================\n+VERSION.C                                          *dev-vim-patches-version.c*\n+\n+The list of Vim patches in `src/nvim/version.c` is automatically updated\n+https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7780 based on the presence of\n+`vim-patch:xxx` tokens in the Nvim git log.\n+\n+- Don't update `src/nvim/version.c` yourself.\n+    - `scripts/vim-patch.sh -p` intentionally omits `version.c` to avoid merge\n+      conflicts and save time when porting a patch.\n+- The automation script (`scripts/vimpatch.lua`) only recognizes tokens like\n+  `vim-patch:8.0.1206`, not `vim-patch:<hash>`.\n+\n+==============================================================================\n+CODE DIFFERENCES                            *dev-vim-patches-code-differences*\n+\n+The following functions have been removed or deprecated in favor of newer\n+alternatives.

(Nvim\n+  supports Vimscript version 1 _only_.) Be aware that patches labelled `Vim9:`\n+  may still contain applicable fixes to other parts of the codebase, so these\n+  patch need to be checked individually.\n+- Updates to `testdir/Makefile` are usually NA because the Makefile implicitly\n+  finds\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/8a677f8a4bff6005fa39f090c14e970c3dfdbe6e#diff-b3c6ad6680a25a1b42095879e3a87104R52\n+  all `test_*.vim` files.\n+- Compiler warning fixes: Nvim strives to have no warnings at all, and has a\n+  very different build system from Vim.\n+    - Note: Coverity fixes in Vim are relevant to Nvim.\n+- `*.proto` changes: Nvim autogenerates function prototypes\n+- #ifdef tweaking: For example, Vim decided to enable `FEAT_VISUAL` for all\n+  platforms - but Nvim already does that. Adding new `FEAT_` guards also isn't\n+  relevant to Nvim.\n+- Legacy system support: Fixes for legacy systems such as Amiga, OS/2 Xenix,\n+  Mac OS 9, Windows older than XP SP2, are not needed because they are not\n+  supported by Nvim.\n+    - NA files: src/Make_, src/testdir/Make__\n+- if_*.c changes: `if_python.c` et. al. were removed.\n+- term.c changes: the Nvim TUI uses libtermkey to read terminal sequences;\n+  Vim's `term.c` was removed.\n+- `job` patches: incompatible API and implementation\n+    - NA files: src/channel_, src/job_, src/testdir/test_channel_,\n+      src/testdir/test_job_\n+- `:terminal` patches that modify NA files: incompatible API and\n+  implementation\n+    - NA files: src/terminal_, src/testdir/test_terminal_\n+- `defaults.vim` patches\n+- Most GUI-related changes: Nvim GUIs are implemented external to the core C\n+  codebase.\n+    - NA files: src/gui_, src/gvim_, src/GvimExt/, src/testdir/test_gui*\n+- `balloon` changes: Nvi does not support balloon feature\n+    - NA files: src/beval_, src/testdir/test_balloon_\n+- libvterm changes: Nvim does not vendor libvterm in `src/`.\n+- Screendump tests from `test_popupwin.vim`, `test_popupwin_textprop.vim`:\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12741#issuecomment-704677141\n+- json changes: incompatible API https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/4131\n+    - NA files: src/json*, src/testdir/test_json.vim\n+- `test_restricted.vim` restricted mode is removed in\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/11996\n+- Many tests in `test_prompt_buffer.vim` require incompatible Vim features\n+  such as `channel`; they should still be included, but skipped\n+- non-runtime documentation: Moved to https://neovim.io/doc/,\n+  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki#developers\n+    - NA files: Filelist, README, INSTALL*,\n+- Anything else might be relevant; err on the side of caution, and post an\n+  issue if you aren't sure.\n+\n+==============================================================================\n+VERSION.C                                          *dev-vim-patches-version.c*\n+\n+The list of Vim patches in `src/nvim/version.c` is automatically updated\n+https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7780 based on the presence of\n+`vim-patch:xxx` tokens in the Nvim git log.\n+\n+- Don't update `src/nvim/version.c` yourself.\n+    - `scripts/vim-patch.sh -p` intentionally omits `version.c` to avoid merge\n+      conflicts and save time when porting a patch.\n+- The automation script (`scripts/vimpatch.lua`) only recognizes tokens like\n+  `vim-patch:8.0.1206`, not `vim-patch:<hash>`.\n+\n+==============================================================================\n+CODE DIFFERENCES                            *dev-vim-patches-code-differences*\n+\n+The following functions have been removed or deprecated in favor of newer\n+alternatives.
