This appears to be an issue with `vim.region`, where only one byte is copied of the last character~~\r\n- When a visual selection is active, the contents of the last visual selection are returned (instead of the currently active visual selection)\r\n- Does not work as a command (`:lua vim.get_visual_selection()`), and does not work in visual block mode\r\n\r\nPinging @clason, @bfredl, @tjdevries involved in the discussion on Gitter/Matrix",

I had to do some wrangling of the start and end columns, but it works fine now. \r\nHowever I see an important issue - the function returns the _last_ visual selection instead of the current one when there is currently a visual selection. This happens because the `'<` and `'>` marks are updated after the visual mode ends. Need to find a solution for that.\r\nA slightly smaller issue, the function cannot be called correctly as a command (at least right now) as `:lua print(vim.get_visual_selection())`, because it changes to commandline mode when you do it that way. It would be nice to find a way to detect that a visual selection was active just before entering commandline mode (I'm not sure if this would be very useful, but nice to have anyway)",

I suppose it would not belong to this PR though?\r\n\r\n@tjdevries Using a mapping works partially i.e, it detects the visual mode correctly (and therefore runs), however the `'<` and `'>` marks are not set until after leaving visual mode. So for instance, I can either call it as a command and it will detect the 'current' selection (which is actually the last selection, since the user left visual mode), but future calls will still return the last selection even if there is no current visual selection. Or I can call it through a mapping, which correctly detects when there is an active visual selection and only runs then, but does not detect the current visual selection and uses the previous one instead. (I hope that was clear, it's kinda hard to explain for me :))",

Once finished, I'll commit it to telescope for review to ultimately make a PR to refactor `vim.region` with full char, line, and block-selection support. (telescope commit will ease review and debugging as it returns visual selection rather than region)\r\n\r\nIn addition, `vim.get_visual_selection` probably should feature arguments `trim` (default=true) and `delimiter` (default=' ' ?) such that users can optionally augment their output. I'm also afraid visual block mode support will require significant changes to how positions of marks are retrieved (will be factored out) as more info from `vim.fn.getpos` is needed than presented here to later resolve visual columns (as in, actual screen columns).",
