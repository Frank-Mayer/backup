If that's the case, shouldn't we report the issue there instead?\r\n\r\nMoreover, it looks like this PR would add the extra step of us keeping `DOXYGEN_URL` up to date with the latest release, which should probably be documented in `MAINTAIN.md`. Still, the existence of this bug makes me feel that something is wrong with our dependency sources, and we shouldn't introduce a hack as dependency consumers.",
