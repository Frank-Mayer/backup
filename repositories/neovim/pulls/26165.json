In order to successfully output Unicode characters, your programming language doesn't actually need much \"Unicode support\"; it just needs to be able to send UTF-8-encoded bytes to stdout. (That's why many modern programming languages like Go and Zig define strings as a simple array of bytes.) Modern C compilers allow you to printf(\"é\") and get the appropriate behavior.\r\n>\r\n> As you mention, the terminal emulator also needs to be able to decode and display those UTF-8 bytes correctly, and a lot of terminals don't get it right in some situations. Off the top of my head, I don't know of a terminal that actually implements the entire (very complex) set of Unicode text rendering behaviors; maybe one of the web-based ones that run in Electron? macOS's Terminal.app is also pretty good IIRC.\r\n>\r\n> Where libgrapheme comes in is if you want to analyze or manipulate a UTF-8-encoded string. It provides operations like \"split into words\" and \"convert to uppercase\". A surprising number of programs never need to do that stuff, but if you do, libgrapheme will give you a Unicode-compatible implementation. (Many more basic operations, like concatenating two strings, will work just fine without libgrapheme.)\r\n\r\nWhich suggests to me it doesn't quite meet our needs.\r\n\r\nIt being Suckless also puts me off.",
