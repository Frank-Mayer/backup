I just don't like creating a bad precedent which is quite more far reaching than the initial decision to apply the container workaround in the first place.\r\n\r\nFor a \"temporary\" solution to actually be temporary not become permanent, it needs to be ripped off at some point, even if that particular point always is going to be disruptive and appear arbitrary to some.
