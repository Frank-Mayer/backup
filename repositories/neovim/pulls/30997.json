No one has configured the other formats to work (and I don't want think neovim should maintain code for 10 different package formats). \n\n> I see one benefit (for single user desktop instances): deb package is easy to uninstall \n\nHoldup. Didn't you say the problem with appimages were that they can't be used in containers, and that the benefit of deb packages is that they are easy to uninstall. But containers are also easy to \"uninstall\". So the one drawback you mentioned for appimages is where deb packages won't help either IIUC.",
