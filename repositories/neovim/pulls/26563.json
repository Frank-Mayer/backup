    "body": "This pull request is trying to continue work along the lines of #16008, but it gives both a global and a buffer local option (`vim.go.tsmatchlimit` and `vim.bo.tsmatchlimit`). A similar discussion about a different way of setting up treesitter can be found in #15260, where it was discussed if we should make something like `vim.treesitter.config(...)` (similar to `vim.diagnostics.config(...)`).\r\n\r\nThe current code is only a draft for now (I have almost no experience in working with C or the neovim code base), but it works as intended.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nThe main goal of this pull request is fixing the problem of highlighting a deep tree with something like `rainbow-delimiters` as described in #26325. \r\n\r\nAs identified in that issue the main problem is that a value of 256 in\r\n```c\r\nts_query_cursor_set_match_limit(cursor, 256);\r\n```\r\nis not always high enough. (Note: This value has been raised once already from 64 to 256.)\r\n\r\nOf course this problem could be fixed by raising the limit once again, but it was specifically chosen to be relatively low for performance reasons (discussed in #22055 where there is also discussion about maybe introducing a timeout for the query instead). Therefore it might be better to allow users to adjust this value themselves, especially since this would also allow for trying to lower the value if you run into treesitter performance issues. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, a global value for this match limit is not really a good idea, since users might have different preferences depending on e.g. the language they are working in or the file size of the file they are editing (really anything that can effect treesitter highlighting and performance). Thus it makes sense to allow for local adjustment to the match limit value.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\n\r\nExpose `vim.go.tsmatchlimit` and `vim.bo.tsmatchlimit` for setting this value globally or locally (within a buffer). \r\n\r\nFor example I have so far mainly run into problems with the match limit of 256 in `:InspectTree`, so something like the following allows for increasing the match limit there and lowering it elsewhere:\r\n \r\n```lua\r\nvim.go.tsmatchlimit = 32 -- mainly to make the difference clearer\r\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"FileType\", {\r\n\tgroup = augroup,\r\n\tpattern = \"*\",\r\n\tcallback = function(args)\r\n\t\tlocal lang = vim.treesitter.language.get_lang(args.match)\r\n\t\tif lang == 'query' then\r\n\t\t\tvim.bo.tsmatchlimit = 2048\r\n\t\tend\r\n\tend,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Of course you could target this better than just looking at the language, but this is fine for an example.)\r\n\r\nHere is the start of my `:InspectTree` with `vim.go.tsmatchlimit = 32` without the auto command:\r\n<img width=\"288\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 23 39 21\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7075380/a0ea977b-bcb8-4b46-be85-143417e99f06\">\r\n\r\nAnd with the above auto command:\r\n<img width=\"287\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-12-13 at 23 39 49\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7075380/4e294261-3bf2-4efd-92bb-e9e8678f94f2\">\r\n\r\nYou can see that a match limit of 32 (and even 256 in this case) is too low for `rainbow-delimiters` to allow capturing the outer `section`. \r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to allow changing the value via `vim.treesitter.config(...)`, which I think could also work fine. In general I would just like a way of adjusting the value. \r\n\r\nAs a side note: I get very weird errors when using small values for the `tsmatchlimit` (like 1, 2 or 4 for example), where some key presses jump outside the neovim window and into my terminal shell prompt. Is there anything in neovim that expects the value to always be at least 32? (Or some other number >4?)",

Options are a mistake.)\r\n\r\nI think the fact that it also allows you to lower the number from 256 to about 32 helps a bit with how useful something like this would be. That can maybe speed up highlighting for people in some cases(?), and it is only rare that we even need to go to 256 (the current default). Also, it does seem to affect more than just `rainbow-delimiters` based on @wookayin's comment above, though I do agree that it is a very uncommon problem to run into. \r\n\r\nAlso, I only watched part of @famiu's talk, but maybe I should rewatch it. :)\r\n\r\n> So I don't think this approach is acceptable.

I was mainly making the option to build on some of the older work already done (as said earlier, I am not very familiar with the neovim codebase or c in general). \r\n\r\nIf we allow for adjusting this when calling `iter_captures` and `iter_matches` that allows for much better control, which makes more sense since I only really want the option to affect one plugin in special cases (as you noted).\r\n\r\nWould adding this as an option similar to how we do `max_start_depth` in `iter_matches` be a more acceptable solution for everyone?",
