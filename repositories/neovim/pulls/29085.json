The `css` commentstring is already set in lua to `/*%s*/`, which is correct, so I haven't changed it.\r\n\r\n> fix the fallout from this breaking change by explicitly setting all derived commentstrings correctly(!) (if at all reasonable, to the same value Vim uses -- because changes to those should go through upstream).\r\n\r\nSorry I'm getting confused here. In the previous comment you mentioned\r\n\r\n> for any ftplugin that includes a `runtime! ftplugin/c.vim`, add a separate ftplugin in Lua that sets the commentstring explicitly (as `// %s` if it's C-type: `objc`, `ch`, or the actually correct commentstring if it isn't: `xdefaults`, `xs`, `css`);\r\n\r\nI've checked the ones I've changed accept `// %s` as comments, and have changed them appropriately. I've only added arduino, since it was broken due to the default commentstring removed in 0.9(vim has default `/**/`, so this is not a problem for them).\r\n\r\n@echasnovski Probably my setup is borked, and I'm not proficient enough to debug it.

Either `xs` is broken for vim, and then it would be pulled from upstream when it is corrected there, or it is empty. Since I don't know what the correct commentstring is yet, I'd rather not add a wrong one. Let's wait till Monday? ",
