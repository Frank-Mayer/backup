    "body": "This is a follow up to #26334.\r\n\r\nRelated to #26369. Related to #26378.\r\nResolves #26385. Resolves #26389. Resolves #26468.\r\n\r\nIt mostly follows a list from the first task of #26369.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nHere are the important points which might deserve extra attention during review:\r\n\r\n1. Lightness values of `Nvim{Dark,Light}Grey1` (darkest/lightest) and `Nvim{Dark,Light}Grey2` (`Normal` highlight group) are made more extreme to increase contrast ratio. This makes background darker/lighter with foreground lighter/darker. This also prompted non-grey colors to shift a bit as they have lightness taken from `Normal` group.\r\n\r\n    I **really** think that current values have the most possible compromise between \"much contrast\" and \"not too much contrast\" camps. All contrast ratio values passed previously (except objectively hard \"saturated dark cyan\") and now they pass even better (for example, `Comment` is now closer to passing with AAA than with AA).\r\n\r\n1. `cterm` values are changed to use colors 0-6 and 9-15 to more utilize terminal colors and be treated more like \"emergency exit\" values (especially after #26407 is merged). Both dark/light variant use only 8 colors: one background, one foreground, and 6 colors (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan). Not using shades of grey (7 for dark-ish foreground and 8 for grey) allows a UI which is more robust towards terminal color palette not designed for these greys to be used together with non-grey colors.\r\n\r\n    Currently the only assumption about terminal palette is that \"Background color 0 can be used as background; foreground and colors can be used as foreground\". This essentially limits the possible fg-bg color combinations to bg-{fg,red,green,yellow,blue,magenta,cyan} and fg-bg (inverted `Normal`).\r\n\r\n    Most UI decisions are similar to ones from 'quiet' color scheme in case of only 16 colors available. Colors are translated from the corresponding `gui*` values: 9-14 for dark variant and 1-6 for light (to possibly have more contrast).\r\n\r\n1. All highlight groups are reworked to follow \"add attribute only if it is intended to be different\". This includes two cases:\r\n    - Add `guifg`/`ctermfg` if it is meant to have different foreground. For example, most \"basic\" syntax groups (`Constant`, `Operator`, `PreProc`, `Type`, `Delimiter`) are left without definition. This means that they will inherit the foreground, which is usually OK but can lead to not really good result inside markdown code blocks (falling back to `@text.literal` which links to `Comment`). @clason, this is probably better be addressed in tree-sitter highlight groups rework, correct?\r\n\r\n    - Add `guibg`/`ctermbg` if it is meant to have different background. This resolves some issues with `DiagnosticFloating*`.\r\n\r\n1. Specific highlight group decisions which might need discussion:\r\n\r\n    1. `CurSearch` is changed to actually be different from `Search` (with antipodal lightness value of yellow as background). This adds another breaking behavior for color scheme authors, but seems to be worth having in default color scheme.\r\n\r\n    1. `WinSeparator` was previously linked to a `VertSplit` for compatibility with Vim's color scheme. As `VertSplit` is deprecated since 0.8, I decided to revert the link. Even now I think it is a reasonable thing to do, but this might need extra discussion. Here are possible actions:\r\n        - Leave the current `VertSplit -> WinSeparator -> Normal` linking dependency.\r\n        - Revert to have `WinSeparator -> VertSplit -> Normal`.\r\n        - Remove `VertSplit` entirely from default color scheme. Having it linked to `WinSeparator` is beneficial only to allow Neovim targeted color schemes work in Vim, which is rarely the case. So removing it completely might be reasonable here.\r\n\r\n    1. As current default `EndOfBuffer` is already quite non intrusive, I don't think having it being separate from `Whitespace` adds benefit to address [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21694#issuecomment-1575756133). So nothing has changed here in this follow up.\r\n\r\n    1. `PmenuSel` (current selection in pop-up menu) in the #26334 was changed to include `blend=0`. This is because if pop-up menu is transparent, current selection also amplifies the background text which makes it very uncomfortable to read. As this is a breaking change, it might be worth a discussion of whether this is necessary.\r\n\r\n    1. `FloatShadow` and `FloatShadowThrough` are changed to have `Grey4` color implementing \"soft shadow\". This is mostly to make them visible with both dark and light color scheme variants.\r\n\r\n    1. `FloatFooter` is changed to link to `FloatTitle` (instead of previous `Title`).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nInformation about new color scheme:\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Palette</summary>\r\n\r\n- `#004c73` (Dark blue)\r\n- `#007373` (Dark cyan)\r\n- `#005523` (Dark green)\r\n- `#07080d` (Dark grey1)\r\n- `#14161b` (Dark grey2)\r\n- `#2c2e33` (Dark grey3)\r\n- `#4f5258` (Dark grey4)\r\n- `#470045` (Dark magenta)\r\n- `#590008` (Dark red)\r\n- `#6b5300` (Dark yellow)\r\n- `#a6dbff` (Light blue)\r\n- `#8cf8f7` (Light cyan)\r\n- `#b3f6c0` (Light green)\r\n- `#eef1f8` (Light grey1)\r\n- `#e0e2ea` (Light grey2)\r\n- `#c4c6cd` (Light grey3)\r\n- `#9b9ea4` (Light grey4)\r\n- `#ffcaff` (Light magenta)\r\n- `#ffc0b9` (Light red)\r\n- `#fce094` (Light yellow)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Contrast ratio values</summary>\r\n\r\n`dark_*` are for dark color scheme, `ligth_*` - for light.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndark_blue         = 12.2\r\ndark_comment      = 6.7\r\ndark_comment_cur  = 5.1\r\ndark_comment_vis  = 2.9\r\ndark_cur_line     = 10.5\r\ndark_cyan         = 14.6\r\ndark_green        = 14.5\r\ndark_magenta      = 13.1\r\ndark_normal       = 14\r\ndark_red          = 11.6\r\ndark_visual       = 6.1\r\ndark_yellow       = 14\r\nlight_blue        = 7.1\r\nlight_comment     = 6.1\r\nlight_comment_cur = 4.6\r\nlight_comment_vis = 2.9\r\nlight_cur_line    = 10.6\r\nlight_cyan        = 4.4\r\nlight_green       = 7\r\nlight_magenta     = 12\r\nlight_normal      = 14\r\nlight_red         = 11.4\r\nlight_visual      = 6.7\r\nlight_yellow      = 5.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Screenshots</summary>\r\n\r\nWith `termguicolors`:\r\n\r\n![default-cs2_dark_tgc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/5a730823-7579-49cf-bc1d-9c9e16cb488a)\r\n![default-cs2_dark_tgc_diff](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/5b56ca08-e193-4e26-97a7-1fe8e38586eb)\r\n![default-cs2_light_tgc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/7a1939f0-2196-43fe-8c7c-04fd45056611)\r\n![default-cs2_light_tgc_diff](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/17337301-5116-4209-bb83-eaea87b63e18)\r\n\r\nWith `notermguicolors` and [VGA color palette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit) (for popular terminal palettes it should look better):\r\n\r\n![default-cs2_dark_notgc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/86cccdd6-a632-487a-8b8a-27da64921fed)\r\n![default-cs2_dark_notgc_diff](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/1cdb3785-3dae-4778-be4b-054be259b7da)\r\n![default-cs2_light_notgc](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/695c6c34-689e-452b-b485-2824b9a99540)\r\n![default-cs2_light_notgc_diff](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/91a3fa98-6ef3-4fcb-80ec-4c1e243c87fd)\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n",

All contrast ratio values passed previously (except objectively hard \"saturated dark cyan\") and now they pass even better (for example, `Comment` is now closer to passing with AAA than with AA).\r\n\r\nI love the new contrast ratio much better. Well done!\r\n\r\n>    1. `CurSearch` is changed to actually be different from `Search` (with antipodal lightness value of yellow as background). This adds another breaking behavior for color scheme authors, but seems to be worth having in default color scheme.\r\n\r\nThis is a good decision imo. Having `CurSearch` be different is actually immensely helpful in my personal usecase, at least.\r\n\r\n>    2. `WinSeparator` was previously linked to a `VertSplit` for compatibility with Vim's color scheme. As `VertSplit` is deprecated since 0.8, I decided to revert the link. Even now I think it is a reasonable thing to do, but this might need extra discussion. Here are possible actions:\r\n>       \r\n>       * Leave the current `VertSplit -> WinSeparator -> Normal` linking dependency.\r\n>       * Revert to have `WinSeparator -> VertSplit -> Normal`.\r\n>       * Remove `VertSplit` entirely from default color scheme. Having it linked to `WinSeparator` is beneficial only to allow Neovim targeted color schemes work in Vim, which is rarely the case. So removing it completely might be reasonable here.\r\n\r\nIMO, there is absolutely no reason to do #1. If we don't want to do #2, then we should do #3 and not #1.\r\nNow, as for what to do between #2 and #3. The only reason to do #2, IMO, would be to have compatibility with using Vim colorscheme plugins in Neovim, which is a valid reason. It just depends on how much we care about that. I personally think removing the link is a good idea in the long term, but losing compatibility with Vim colorschemes is a price to pay for that. Then again, the user can just manually link the highlight groups, so I'm not sure if it's really as big of a deal.",

            "body": "Sorry, @justinmk, only now have discovered edits in [your comment about highlight group tweaks](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26369#issuecomment-1837497703).\r\n\r\n> * (Edit): Also `Search`. I am not seeing a reason why `Search` needs to be yellow. In general \"block highlights\" are something that can be used to make special cases standout without introducing a new color. Example:\r\n>  ```\r\n>  hi Search guibg=cyan guifg=black\r\n>  hi CurSearch guifg=black guibg=NvimDarkCyan\r\n>  ```\r\n\r\nYellow is quite objectively the best possible color for `Search` and `CurSearch`. For at least these reasons:\r\n- Yellow is reserved to \"mean mild user attention\", which `Search`, `CurSearch`, and `IncSearch` is one of the primary examples.\r\n- Yellow is not used in any UI or Syntax groups (except `DiagnosticWarn` which usually can't intersect with search). So it can't possibly get in the situation of blending in the surrounding text. While this can happen if using cyan or blue for that. Here are examples:\r\n\r\n    <details><summary>Using background lightness for `Search` background</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:33:17](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/b4d7dff0-aa21-4426-ab94-96470e75aadc)\r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:33:26](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/f8a283d2-2344-457d-8618-f9438a1076fd)\r\n    \r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n    <details><summary>Using foreground lightness for `Search` background</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:31:56](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/d95a5bb4-3948-4af5-865d-ae60b3440abd)\r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:32:33](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/b5149970-9b7c-4670-9ae9-2698e4b1a3ee)\r\n    \r\n    </details>\r\n    \r\n    <details><summary>Behavior after this PR (yellow with background lightness for `Search` background</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:34:12](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/66433de8-22bc-4142-96ae-0a35cb5b2bed)\r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:34:18](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/3124701e-6c9f-4354-82c7-ed72cececcae)\r\n    \r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n    In both cases of using cyan, there is an instance of using very close color for background as for surrounding foreground. The only way to solve this is to not use color which can be seen in the text, i.e. green/cyan/blue. So using yellow is the best approach here.\r\n\r\n> * (Edit): `StatusLine` should be more clearly distinct from `StatusLineNC` (probably by dimming the bg of \"NC\")\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, not really possible as statusline already uses the darkest background.\r\n\r\nI can suggest one of the two approaches here:\r\n- Use same background as `Normal` for `StatusLineNC`, which will essentially hide statusline. Here are examples:\r\n    <details><summary>Blended `StatusLineNC`</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:48:34](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/3256025c-0314-4833-9c59-a464cb2f3672)\r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:48:44](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/6fbe4c96-a00d-4584-a286-3950dd1a5d54)\r\n    \r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n- In case that blend is too much (which it think it is not), add `gui=bold` for both `StatusLine` and `StatusLineNC` (note that this will affect `TabLine` and `WinBar`).:\r\n    <details><summary>Blended `StatusLineNC` and bold text in any statusline</summary>\r\n    \r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:49:25](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/b3bb2f28-f878-460a-91ab-509f6b69db60)\r\n    ![screenshot_2023-12-13_12:49:31](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24854248/de975d1f-bf5d-4ac7-ac87-7361fbc89a1e)\r\n\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n> * (Edit): diffAdded, diffRemoved need explicit overrides, they should be green/red\r\n>  ```\r\n>  hi diffAdded guifg=lightgreen\r\n>  hi diffRemoved guifg=lightred\r\n>  hi! link Type Comment\r\n>  ```\r\n\r\nI assumed this is a task for filetype syntax, i.e. ['runtime/syntax/diff.vim'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/d65c6a0bafada059e87a11a4bcd129afc16d2e5d/runtime/syntax/diff.vim#L368-L386).

Here's a shot, tested on WezTerm, with neovim built from this PR:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-12-15 at 2 55 53 PM](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7416158/9d7f83b9-2433-45e3-ba2e-d675bf851a54)\r\n\r\nNote this Comment/Visual issue is on for light version, the dark version is fine.\r\n\r\n>Having `Visual` have `Grey3` background is not really good as it is the same color as used for `CursorLine` and `CursorColumn`, which is slightly confusing. \r\n\r\nNvimLightGrey3 guibg for Visual here at least makes the Comment guifg text visible.\r\nI agree there could be confusion with Visual and CursorLine having same guibg, but when visual mode is started, e.g., doing `vap`, CursorLine highlights don't apply (cursorline isn't drawn). Here's the same pic as above, but now with my change for Visual mode (cursorline is on here):\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-12-15 at 3 05 28 PM](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7416158/b64c5e6e-ada9-4c48-9484-f5029c1ff730)\r\n\r\n> As visual selection very rarely implies actually reading text, and comments are not the most used text, and result is still somewhat readable, I consider this a reasonable compromise.\r\n\r\nThe comments when selected aren't readable at all, unless my setup is doing something odd, but I tested on Linux on macOS in a few different terminal emulators and in Neovide.\r\n \r\n> Same logic applies to `ColorColumn`, but with even less consequences as it is (usually) only single cell wide.\r\n\r\nWhy is the changes in the screenshot below using `hi! ColorColumn guibg=NvimLightGrey1`  not as good as hiding the text? I think that's poor UX - no other colorscheme that is shipped with Neovim does this (look at `colorscheme shine` or `colorscheme quiet` light-version). Yes it's one character hidden, but sometimes I'll have something like `:set cc=10,20,40,60` set, and that would be a bit annoying.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2023-12-15 at 3 06 58 PM](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7416158/0ca52c71-ae8f-4bcc-90f5-eac90034a9e7)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Go with inverted text for `StatusLine` making it *clearly* stand out.

If `StatusLineNC` is not blended with `Normal`, then I feel there is no reason to use `underline` as colors and statusline text should already distinguish windows quite nicely.",
