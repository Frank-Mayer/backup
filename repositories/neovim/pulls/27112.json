This would have the same observable effect (some -- not obviously wrong (IMO) -- highlighting by default) without documenting this as the \"right\" semantic color?\r\n\r\nI don't think making `@markup` `Special` is a good choice here. Judging by previous name (`@text`) and assumed usage, all `@markup.xxx` groups are expected to be used in some sort of plain text scenarios. So I'd say leaving it cleared or link to `Normal` (or define to only have `Normal` foreground) is more appropriate here. Having only `@markup.raw` as `Special` makes more sense to me, as it *is* a \"special type of markup\" with the most significant usage among other subgroups.\r\n\r\nI do agree that default color scheme should define fewer of non-first level `@groups`. For example, right now color schemes need to explicitly define some of them and can not rely on the fallback. Example: most of `@keyword.xxx` groups will not fallback to `@keyword` if color scheme doesn't define them, as there are default link in default color scheme. But that's outside of this PR's scope.",
