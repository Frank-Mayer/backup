Or do what Lewis recommended and design the other areas all around not having to access a single client. But afaik we've had RPC limitations due to the use of uv handles/userdata inside the client - affecting stuff like `LspAttach` autocmds.\r\n\r\nHaving a `.get()` / `.filter()` distinction is also common in other APIs - particularly ORMs. So it's not like we're inventing an entirely new concept here.\r\n\r\nAnd as plugin author I'd still be bothered because the deprecation warning will pop up. So it will cause churn. Not to mention everyone who's using the currently recommended `LspAttach` variant for their lsp setup will likely have warnings.\r\n\r\nAnd if you start telling people that some deprecations are more harmless than others because the code will stick around - well then you're creating a whole new problem in that users and plugin authors have to keep track of which deprecations are serious and require action and which don't.\r\n\r\nIt's the sum of these aspects that to me just don't make it worth it.",
