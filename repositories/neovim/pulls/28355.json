    "body": "Fix #27859. Still a draft because there are other solutions that might be worthwhile, and I haven't written any tests.\r\n\r\nSee my comments on that issue (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27859#issuecomment-2057556931 and https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27859#issuecomment-2057916584) for details on the specific situation that causes the crash. But TLDR:\r\n- there's a hand-rolled msgpack decoder specific to redraw events, implemented as a finite state machine with states 0-16\r\n- the state machine can be interrupted/resumed\r\n- memory for `GridLineEvent`s is allocated in state 11 only\r\n- states 14-16 use the `GridLineEvent` assuming its memory is allocated\r\n- if the state machine completes a cycle (reaches 16) and then executes the redraw event, the grid line event memory is freed\r\n- but if there are any remaining redraw calls, the FSM resumes *directly* at state 14, bypassing the reallocation of the event and writing to \"freed\"[^1] memory\r\n\r\nThe bug is sneaky/tricky because it's only *apparent* in very specific cases, i.e. when the pending channel `rstream` is very large (> `8192` bytes), can't be read in a single step, and another event in between the pending redraw is sent and overwrites the `GridLineEvent` memory before the remaining redraw event data is read.\r\n\r\n**Current approach**: just don't free the memory when returning successfully from `unpacker_advance` midway through a redraw event when the next FSM execution would expect the grid line event memory to be valid.\r\n\r\n**Other approaches**: Don't *ever* allocate/free the grid line event, i.e. store it as a value and not a pointer? It's not that big of a struct..\r\n\r\n[^1]: To be exact, it is *semantically* freed, this is also explained in the comments I linked at the top, but basically it seems like this memory is reused and not actually freed in the OS/process sense which is why its usage doesn't *necessarily* crash\r\n\r\n",
