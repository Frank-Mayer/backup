This also allows us to move some editor commands such as `:edit` away from netrw.\r\n\r\n### Reason for rewrite\r\n\r\nIn #23461, we decided it would be best to not rely on the `curl` command and instead use libcurl directly.\r\n\r\n### Reasons for doing it ourselves\r\n\r\nLua-cURLv3 is looking quite old already, and in reality we are just offloading the burden of writing C to a different party.\r\n\r\nLibcurl is quite easy, and anyone can write a wrapper. But this is not just any old wrapper. is quite specifically *neovim* code. not just `libcurl<->lua` code.\r\n\r\nCurl provides its own solution for async transfers, the multi interface, but neovim has its own internal event system that multi doesnt quite fit into without further event loop modification.\r\n\r\nEven in the multi-interface example on the Lua-cURLv3 repository it requires blocking to resolve the requests so we would need another wrapper to thread them or something and at that point we could introduce a nicer API, and at *that* point we could of written our own thing.\r\n",

TL;DR:\r\n1. the `curl` command is argument hell; different versions (and platforms) have subtly (and not so subtly) different flags and behaviors;\r\n2. the `libcurl` _library_, on the other hand, has a _very_ stable ABI, and a strong promise to keep it that way;\r\n3. the result of that long discussion is _not_ to bundle `libcurl` (for now) and call into the **system** libcurl, which pretty much every supported platform ships with. (This will turn `curl` into a runtime dependency, much like `glibc`.)",
