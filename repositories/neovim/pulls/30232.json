It looks like it has resolved the issue I was having before with throwing off the characters around the emoji and the lines close to it 👍 It does just render the emoji as the regular digit 1 (which I am fine with).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3707e72c-d441-4c68-af6c-dbbb88b40bb4)\r\n\r\nThere are some other issues I noticed though mainly with visual selection as it seems to visually select the multi sequence emoji still as I can see the original rendered emoji sometimes when selecting over it... that is no problem for me. But I noticed that when you are visually selecting if you stop selection on / around the emoji then little cursor remnants get left behind. See the video below.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdd71816-50b4-486c-a7b1-d4b0e50b7cd6\r\n\r\nNot sure if maybe there needs to be a similar patch added to visual mode as well (have no clue if that makes sense or is possible)? It just seems like when in visual mode and selecting over the emoji, it then renders it like previously processing all the codepoints which then throws things off again with the cursor / column positioning / alignment.",

Is my idea 1 an option? Where instead of only allowing setcellwidths() for individual codepoints, you could provide a combination of codepoints? So I could set \"u31 + FE0F + 20E3\" together and set to 2?",

So I could create a concealer to replace this complicated emoji with something simpler that I know works.\n\nOr as an alternative idea, would it be something to consider for neovim to provide a built-in function that could be used similar to setcellwidths() but instead a mapping table of \"Emoji A\" --> \"Emoji B\". So this table would just use emoji B in place of emoji A when loading a buffer that an emoji in your mapping table exists in.\n\nNot sure if that is a crazy idea but just trying to contribute some thoughts from an end user perspective :-) 🤷🏻‍♂️",
