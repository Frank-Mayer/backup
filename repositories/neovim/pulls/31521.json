I think it's pretty good as its own thing, but not sure how much guidance it provides in regards to this specifically. The most relevant is probably \"Optimize 'out of the box', for new users but especially regular users\"? Although not entirely sure what out of the box experience would mean for regular users, that seems like an oxymoron since it wouldn't be out of the box as they already should have existing configuration?\r\n \r\n> The general answer is we want to \"lift\" stuff into Nvim if it is important to our OOTB experience. And having a maintenance strategy for it is also required, as you mentioned.\r\n\r\nMakes sense. Unsure how we'd even start providing guidelines for what constitutes a good OOTB experience, that seems like pure guesswork/artform.\r\n\r\nThe existing texts might be good enough. I think I'll close this for now since it seems there is not an immediate need. Thanks for the input.",
