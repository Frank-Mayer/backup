Why do we need a special-case \"auto\" severity?\r\n\r\nBecause the assumption that \"this is what most people want\" is simply false. `goto_next` implies _next_ diagnostic, not \"most important diagnostic\". If you are opposed to making this optional, the whole functionality needs to go. \r\n\r\n(I still think there's merit in adding an `auto` severity filter, as you _cannot_ know which severities you should filter on at the point of _setting_ the mapping, so this cannot be replicated simply with the filters we have.)",
