    "body": "Closes: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/30729\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces two new pending operators: `[` and `]`.\r\n\r\nIn Neovim/Vim, `dip` deletes a paragraph under the current cursor. This PR now supports two new mappings, `d[ip` and `d]ip`.\r\n\r\n- `d[ip` means \"delete from the start of the paragraph to the current cursor position\"\r\n- `d]ip` means \"delete from the current cursor position to the bottom of the paragraph\"\r\n\r\nMost `{operator}{object}` pairs, for example `dap`, `yip`, `cas`, `daw`, etc etc now have a `{operator}[{object}` and `{operator}]{object}` equivalent.\r\n\r\nAnd of course, this works for custom text objects / plugins. These new `[` and `]` pending operators greatly improve the flexibility and expressiveness of Vim text objects!\r\n\r\n\r\n## How It Works\r\nWhen a user types `d]ap`, we ...\r\n\r\n1. Save the user's current cursor, `v:operator`, `operatorfunc`, and other details as needed\r\n2. Replace `operatorfunc` with our own.\r\n3. Immediately execute the replaced `operatorfunc`.\r\n\r\nAnd once executing...\r\n\r\n1. Restore the previous cursor position, previous `v:operator`, and `operatorfunc`\r\n2. If `[` or `]` was pressed, nudge the Vim `'[` or `']` marks if needed\r\n3. Execute the operation\r\n\r\nFor anyone familiar, this PR is a lua version of [vim-ninja-feet](https://github.com/tommcdo/vim-ninja-feet). Props goes to Tom for the awesome idea!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Considerations For Reviewers\r\nHere's some extra things that are not in the PR but could be useful / importing to consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Question 1 - Should the operator include / exclude the current line (for line-wise text objects)?\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\r\n\r\nWhen operating over whole-lines, `[` can be thought of \"searching up\" for lines and is `]` \"searching down\". When that happens, should the current cursor's line be included in the search?\r\n\r\nFor example take this paragraph of text\r\n\r\n```\r\naaa\r\nbbbb  <-- NOTE: The user's cursor is here\r\ncc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we `d]ip` should the `bbbb` line also be deleted? What about if we use `d[ip`? Should the `bbbb` line be deleted or ignored also?\r\n\r\nCurrently this PR does \"always delete the line, whether we call `[` or `]`\".\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe this could be solved in one of two ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Idea 1 - 4 mappings\r\nInstead of providing `[` and `]` we provide `[/[[` and `]/]]`. So `d[ap` could include the cursor line and `d[[ap` could exclude the cursor line. A user could decide while typing if they care to include the line or not.\r\n\r\n(Note: I think Idea 2 is better, see below)\r\n\r\n#### Idea 2 - Configuration\r\nIf we anticipate that a user would always want to include the cursor line / exclude it then there isn't a need to provide a separate mapping for it. Instead we could provide configuration values such as.\r\n\r\n```\r\ng:inclusive_pending_cursor = nil / \"both\" (default, this PR's behavior)\r\ng:inclusive_pending_cursor = \"up\" (only include the cursor's line if using `[`)\r\ng:inclusive_pending_cursor = \"down\" (only include the cursor's line if using `]`)\r\ng:inclusive_pending_cursor = \"none\" (never include the cursor's line)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if the user actually did want the \"4 mappings\" solution they could define their own omap that temporarily sets `g:inclusive_pending_cursor` before running the regular omap. Which I think makes this idea more flexible than the previous idea.\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Question 2 - Do we want to consider column info even if the text object is a line?\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>Click to expand</summary>\r\n\r\nText objects like `ip` (e.g. `dip`) operate on whole-lines. Currently, the PR respects this. When a user calls `d[ip`, it respects only the cursor's row and ignores the cursor's column position.\r\n\r\nIn visual terms imagine you have text like this\r\n\r\n```\r\naaa\r\nbb|your cursor here|tt\r\ncc\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping `d[ip` would result in this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we considered the cursor's column position, the result instead would be\r\n\r\n```\r\ntt\r\ncc\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a user did want to delete the whole row they could still do it by calling `dd` after calling `d[ip`. But I admit it is a bit wordy. What do you all think?\r\n</details>",

Can you comment on that?\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware the only way to achieve what this PR does is to set a mark, use `v` to begin a range, provide a text object, then jump to the previous mark and then type the text operator. e.g. `mbvap'mgc`. Versus `gc]ap`. There might be a smaller way without this PR but the expressiveness and flexibility shouldn't be discounted. Vim's strength is its concise way of expressing commands and this feature would x3 every mapping that (Neo)vim has available to it.\r\n\r\n> Especially the new module looks to be high-cost\r\n\r\nI'd like to talk about that for a bit. if by new module you mean the `_cursor.lua` file, that's 49 lines of source code. Most of the lines are handling a couple edge cases. I'm assuming by cost you don't actually mean the file's contents but something else that I'm not seeing. Would you please elaborate on that?",
