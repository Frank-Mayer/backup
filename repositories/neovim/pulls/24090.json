Useful to align\r\n\ttext.  Will make screen redrawing slower.\r\n\r\nI guess the fact that it will no longer highlight the actual screen column? The option help also mentions it is useful to align text, not offsetting for inline virtual text goes against that.\r\n\r\nFWIW I don't care if this is merged, I just thought there should be a better solution than what was proposed in #24088.

Literally what is the point of having it if you can't trust it?\r\n\r\nCan't really argue against that, I suppose. At least in my config, I automatically turn off inlay hints in insert mode so it'd only be disorienting in normal mode for me, and I don't really need colorcolumn to tell me anything in normal mode anyway. But that's specific to my config. Considering the general case, I think the utility case does make more sense, despite not being pretty. However, I wonder what behavior other editors with inline virtual text support and colorcolumn/fill-column implement. I think it might be worth trying to be consistent with other editors as well. And there's also the issue with Vim choosing to keep the colorcolumn a straight line (which makes sense imo cause the option is called colorcolumn, which implies a single column).",
