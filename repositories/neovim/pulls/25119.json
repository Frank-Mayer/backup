Though that doesn't matter much.\r\n\r\nIt's now clear to me that simply deleting this code doesn't make any sense. Moving cursor to the position where changes are undone should definitely happen in many cases, like when some text was simply added in INSERT mode or some word/line/paragraph was deleted. And it won't happen anymore if this code will be simply deleted and it would be really strange.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in the end the best solution would be to explicitly mark undo entries with something like \"don't move cursor when this is undone/redone\" in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThough on a low level it's hard to infer those cases without an explicit option. E.g. doing that for all calls to `nvim_buf_set_text` would make sense in case of autoformatting, but if some user action is implemented by a plugin via `nvim_buf_set_text` (think something like split/join) then moving cursor to the point of that change on undo would make perfect sense.",

In general it felt like it's ok to be able to just toggle a flag on a buffer or window for that behavior. Implementation is a bit silly, but it's just a proof of concept for discussion.\r\n\r\nI tested it manually and it seems to work sensibly in most cases. For example renaming a variable not at a definition point and then undoing does not move cursor to definition (assuming definition happens to be the top-most point of edit), it moves cursor to where it was when rename happened though.\r\n\r\nSo in fact it doesn't completely solve the original issue for formatting, because if cursor was in one of the changed regions it will pull it there on undo. I find that behavior useful for renaming and code actions though.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm afraid that to keep this behavior and fix the original issue we would need one more flag to completely ignore cursor position saved in undo block, even in cases when it's inside changed lines.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think probably this is where extmarks would help. May be for that case we could mark everything from first line to start of code action and then from end of code action to last line to signify that cursor should not move if changes happen in those two ranges. Though I'm not sure if we should create some special namespace for internal purposes or create a special kind of extmarks or some option.",

In general it felt like it's ok to be able to just toggle a flag on a buffer or window for that behavior. Implementation is a bit silly, but it's just a proof of concept for discussion.\r\n\r\nI tested it manually and it seems to work sensibly in most cases. For example renaming a variable not at a definition point and then undoing does not move cursor to definition (assuming definition happens to be the top-most point of edit), it moves cursor to where it was when rename happened though.\r\n\r\nSo in fact it doesn't completely solve the original issue for formatting, because if cursor was in one of the changed regions it will pull it there on undo. I find that behavior useful for renaming and code actions though.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm afraid that to keep this behavior and fix the original issue we would need one more flag to completely ignore cursor position saved in undo block, even in cases when it's inside changed lines.\r\n\r\nAnd now I think probably this is where extmarks would help. May be for that case we could mark everything from first line to start of code action and then from end of code action to last line to signify that cursor should not move if changes happen in those two ranges. Though I'm not sure if we should create some special namespace for internal purposes or create a special kind of extmarks or some option.",
