For example: \"2d3w\"\n-\t\t  deletes six words.\n-\t\t- The motion can be backwards, e.g. \"db\" to delete to the\n-\t\t  start of the word.\n-\t\t- The motion can also be a mouse click.

This can be\n-\t\t  used to call a function that does some complicated motion.\n-\t\t  The motion is always charwise exclusive, no matter\n-\t\t  what \":\" command is used.

The\n+                uppercase and lowercase letter designate the same register,\n+                but the lowercase letter is used to overwrite the previous\n+                register contents, while the uppercase letter is used to\n+                append to the previous register contents.  Without the \"\"x\" or\n+                with \"\"\"\" the stored text is put into the unnamed register.\n+\n+                                                        *{}*\n+- {}            Curly braces denote parts of the command which must appear,\n+                but which can take a number of different values.  The\n+                differences between Vim and Vi are also given in curly braces\n+                (this will be clear from the context).\n+\n+                                                        *{char1-char2}*\n+- {char1-char2} A single character from the range char1 to char2.  For\n+                example: {a-z} is a lowercase letter.  Multiple ranges may be\n+                concatenated.  For example, {a-zA-Z0-9} is any alphanumeric\n+                character.\n+\n+                                                *{motion}* *movement*\n+- {motion}      A command that moves the cursor.  These are explained in\n+                |motion.txt|.\n+                - Examples:\n+                  - `w`           to start of next word\n+                  - `b`           to begin of current word\n+                  - `4j`          four lines down\n+                  - `/The<CR>`    to next occurrence of \"The\"\n+                - This is used after an |operator| command to move over the\n+                  text that is to be operated upon.\n+                  - If the motion includes a count and the operator also has\n+                    a count, the two counts are multiplied.  For example:\n+                    \"2d3w\" deletes six words.\n+                  - The motion can be backwards, e.g. \"db\" to delete to the\n+                    start of the word.\n+                  - The motion can also be a mouse click.  The mouse is not\n+                    supported in every terminal though.\n+                  - The \":omap\" command can be used to map characters while an\n+                    operator is pending.\n+                  - Ex commands can be used to move the cursor.  This can be\n+                    used to call a function that does some complicated motion.\n+                    The motion is always charwise exclusive, no matter what\n+                    \":\" command is used.  This means it's impossible to\n+                    include the last character of a line without the line\n+                    break (unless 'virtualedit' is set). If the Ex command\n+                    changes the text before where the operator starts or jumps\n+                    to another buffer the result is unpredictable.  It is\n+                    possible to change the text further down.  Jumping to\n+                    another buffer is possible if the current buffer is not\n+                    unloaded.\n+\n+                                                        *{Visual}*\n+- {Visual}      A selected text area.  It is started with the \"v\", \"V\", or\n+                CTRL-V command, then any cursor movement command can be used\n+                to change the end of the selected text.\n+                This is used before an |operator| command to highlight the\n+                text that is to be operated upon.\n+                See |Visual-mode|.\n+\n+                                                        *<character>*\n+- <character>   A special character from the table below, optionally with\n+                modifiers, or a single ASCII character with modifiers.\n+\n+                                                        *'character'*\n+- 'c'           A single ASCII character.\n+\n+                                                        *CTRL-{char}*\n+- CTRL-{char}   {char} typed as a control character; that is, typing {char}\n+                while holding the CTRL key down.  The case of {char} is\n+                ignored; thus CTRL-A and CTRL-a are equivalent.  But in\n+                some terminals and environments, using the SHIFT key will\n+                produce a distinct code (e.g. CTRL-SHIFT-a); in these\n+                environments using the SHIFT key will not trigger commands\n+                such as CTRL-A.\n+\n+                                                        *'option'*\n+- 'option'      An option, or parameter, that can be set to a value, is\n+                enclosed in single quotes.  See |options|.\n+\n+                                                        *quotecommandquote*\n+- \"command\"     A reference to a command that you can type is enclosed in\n+                double quotes.\n+- `command`     New style command, this distinguishes it from other quoted\n+                text and strings.\n+\n+                                        *key-notation* *key-codes* *keycodes*\n These names for keys are used in the documentation.
