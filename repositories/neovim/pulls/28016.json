This information can be used to for example detect floating window borders and winbars for a smooth scrolling implementation. Another example use case is to detect the splits, so that the mouse cursor can be changed when hovering it.\r\n\r\nI guess that the original idea of `ext_hlstate` and it's `ui` key was similar, but currently that is useless since it does not encode the original highlight groups of linked groups. It also does not nearly capture the same information as this addition does.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation for further description.\r\n\r\nA Neovide example implementation is here:\r\n* https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2438\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23610\r\n\r\nNOTE: I have only implemented a few element types now, since I think it's better that we get a first implementation that fixes the immediate problem before making it perfect.\r\n\r\nThe screen.lua had to be reworked quite extensively to support this, because the tests themselves, are using a different format than the internal ui attribute definition. I hope that does not infer with the work that @bfredl is doing, I noticed that since I had to do some fixes myself, due to yesterday's refactoring.",

            "body": "The rest of the documentation does not really motivate each extension's existence either, so I didn't add that information to the documentation. But I can add a short description if needed.\r\n\r\nThe motivation is in the PR description and in the linked issue, but here's a longer one.\r\n\r\nThe immediate problem for Neovide is that UI elements like winbars, and borders are not detectable by the existing UI extensions, at least not in the general case, when the highlight group is something different than `FloatBorder` or `WinBar`. And they are part of the same grid as the buffer, so without being able to detect them it's not possible to know which parts of the grid should scroll.\r\n\r\nI originally requested for them to be represented as separate grids, so we wouldn't need to care, but that was turned down by @bfredl here https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23610#issuecomment-1867430580\r\n\r\nBut when I started to think more about it, I could think about plenty of more use cases. Changing the mouse shape when hovering elements is one of them, and that needs to be responsive, so a roundtrip to nvim is not an option. That's also one example, where only giving information about the borders as suggested, is not enough. You might want to change the cursor when hovering over URL links in the middle of the window for example.\r\n\r\nAnother use case is to render some of these elements in a more native style. For example, if we know that the type is s a border, then we could skip rendering the outer edges(background) of the glyphs. But to do that we need to know that it's a border, it could also be regular buffer text at the edge of the window. This is an alternative to having separate heavyweight extensions for everything, like `ext_tabline`, which also requires taking over the layout and a lot of other things.\r\n\r\nBTW, I think UI elements is the correct term here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_graphical_user_interface_elements, for example a border is not of the widget subtype. But some of the elements are indeed widgets.",

Even if the `ui` key of `info` array actually referred to the original built-in highlight group, it still can't capture all the information that I capture here, it can only use actual highlight groups. And I'm not sure if that was the actual intention or not either. It also contains a lot of useless information, at least for Neovide, and currently I can't think of anything we would like to use it for, so in Neovide we only need this new `ext_elementype` extension.\r\n\r\nThat said, this new extension shares almost everything with `ext_hlstate`, including almost all of the implementation, but instead of extending `info`, it adds `element_tags`, so it's more like a sub-option of `ext_hlstate`. So mabye it's possible to combine them somehow. But if that's the case, I think we need to fix the current performance problems that `ext_hlstate`, but not `ext_elementtype` also suffers from, it sends N(N+1) / 2 `hl_attr_define events` when deleting lines.\r\n",

            "body": "I'm not sure about mixing two different types of concepts here, just to get rid of an additional extension.\r\n\r\n1. The highlight groups.\r\n   * Have attributes assigned to them\r\n   * Are sometimes combined, sometimes blended together\r\n   * Can be linked to another group\r\n   * Describes a cell's visual appearance like a CSS style\r\n2. The element types\r\n   * Are just tags, without any attributes\r\n   * They are always additive, several types can be assigned to a cell\r\n   * Are absolutely not allowed to be linked to something else\r\n   * Describes the functionality of a cell, like a html element type\r\n\r\nPerhaps the confusion comes from the fact that I added it to the `hl_attr_define` UI event? I could have created a similar event that shares over 90% of the implementation, but sharing code is not too easy do in C especially since I have very little practical straight C experience. Alternatively, the event could be named `cell_attr_define`, but we have to deal with backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you want me to keep the current structure and add the element type to the info array? But that does not make much sense IMO. It's already confusing with some fields valid for only some types, like `ui_name` only valid for the `ui` kind. I have honestly no idea what this even means, because for example a floating window title has `kind = syntax` and the `hi_name = Title`, while the border has `kind = ui`, `hi_name = FloatBorder` and `ui_name = FloatBorder`\r\n\r\nSince the element type is a combination of tags, the bitfield representation I add here is much more compact and easier to parse and use.\r\n\r\nUsing actual highlight groups and links here makes even less sense. The `HLEntry` struct which the code deals with does not have any information about linked highlight groups, they are resolved way before that. And neither does the info array, you need a tree-like structure to represent the all the different highlight groups in a cell and their parents, an array is not enough.\r\n\r\nBut those are just the technical challenges, there are numerous design problems, that at least I can't solve, here are a few examples:\r\n\r\n1. Let's say we have the two highlight groups `FloatBorder` and `FloatTitle`, and the user links them together, how can we ever know which one is which? Remember, the link can go in either direction.\r\n2. If the user sets a custom highlight group for the floating window border. How do we represent that? Do we automatically also add a \"magic\" \"FloatBorder\" highlight that doesn't define any attributes to the cell in addition to the user highlight group? \r\n3. How do we represent combinations, `FloatBorder, FloatTitle, Top`? For the title at the top, which also happens to be logically a border. The user could specify highlights for all of them, which one is used? Or do we not support it at all? In this case the `FloatTitle` encodes everything, if we also have `FloatFooter`, but what about `FloatBorder, Top, Left`, that's useful information that won't be possible to encode.\r\n4. Some of the more meta of the element types like `Top` doesn't even make sense as a highlight group, what does it mean to specify some highlight for `Top`?\r\n\r\nI'm sure that all of this is \"solvable\", but at what cost? The current implementation is less than 100 lines of code if you remove the testing code, I'm sure any of the above implementations will be more complex, especially if we also have to fix the bugs in `ext_hlstate`. At Neovide we are overflooded with bugreports about crashes, slowdowns and poor scrolling behaviour, so we would rather see this fixed sooner than later, and really hope to get this for nvim 0.10. Also, in that sense, adding a new extension that is not used in the wild, is much safer than fixing some \"bug\" that users rely on.\r\n\r\n> \"information overflow\" shouldn't be a big problem in practice as UI:s can extract the useful info at definition time (they don't need to rework anything per cell).\r\n\r\nIf information overload does not matter, why isn't `ext_hlstate` enabled by default then? The difference is just between getting an array of zero elements, and an array with information you don't care about, it wouldn't break any clients.\r\n\r\nBut it's not just about information overflow, it's also about performance. Neovide runs in real time, and for a smooth experience we should get responses as soon as possible, preferably within a frame of 8ms. Especially when scrolling it needs to be fast, if it starts taking more than the keyboard repeat rate of around 30 ms, all hope is lost and updates starts to stack on top of each other, and it starts to lag badly. We also can't afford millions of pointless `ext_hlstate` events when deleting text, but that's a bug and should be fixable. \r\n\r\nPS. It would also have been nice to have had this discussion before I started with the implementation, especially since @justinmk gave a thumbs up here https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23610#issuecomment-1929366416.\r\n",

Static information related to the window is also a little bit inflexible, for example, consider the floating window titles, they also need the exact position horizontally (to prevent one of errors, by having the clients calculate it themselves. There are also elements like splits, that does not belong to a window, but still, something that an UI might want to know about. For example, in Neovide we would like to display a different cursor when the mouse is over a split, once mouseshape support is implemented https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21458.\r\n\r\nExplaining why the proposed solution is not optimal and given that there were no further comments and a thumbs up by justinmk, I assumed that everyone agreed, especially since I said that I will start working on it.",
