    "body": "In https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/167, we discovered that Neovim's progress ringbuf size is too small to accommodate huge bursts of messages from LSP servers. Notably, for large Rust projects, rust-analyzer blasts so many messages that later progress messages overwrite earlier completion messages. For LSP progress plugins like [fidget.nvim](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim), those tasks whose completion messages are overwritten seem to run forever.\r\n\r\nThis PR is very simple, it just bumps the LSP progress ringbuf size from 50 to 1024. I'm not actually sure whether this is the \"right\" solution---but it is the simplest---so I'm just filing this as a draft PR to start a discussion.\r\n\r\nAlternative solutions I can think of are:\r\n1. grow the of the `ringbuf` using an autocmd callback listening for the `LspAttach` event, as I suggest [here](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/167#issuecomment-1816705057)\r\n2. change Fidget to be purely event-driven and check the ringbuf on every `LspProgress` event (as described [here](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/167#issuecomment-1813604877)), instead of the current heartbeat-driven execution model\r\n3. patch rust-analyzer to rate-limit its progress messages\r\n\r\nI've provided alternative 1 as [a convenience option in Fidget](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/commit/5be956d940d3ebeb7ea04289382117876c68ce13), but I'm wondering if it makes sense for Neovim's default to be large enough to accommodate these bursts.\r\n\r\nI'm also fine with alternative 2, though I do hope to maintain Fidget's periodic polling model since it has made [other features really easy to implement](https://github.com/j-hui/fidget.nvim/issues/73#issuecomment-1806638776).\r\n\r\nAlternative 3 seems like it could involve a lot of work, and put additional burden on LSP servers.",

Depending on how they're consumed you could miss either part. For the integrated `lsp.status` that doesn't matter because it only displays the title and message (and we carry forward the title).\r\n\r\nThe reason the `progress` buffer is as it is was due to the fact that by default nobody is consuming the messages. That also motivated the small buffer size. The implementation we had before stored the messages under their token as key in a table, but that leaks memory if unconsumed. An alternative would be to group the messages by token until they `end`, and then place them into the buffer, but then you only get a message once the operation is completed. That would be too late.\r\nAnd the idea was that any plugin which requires to observe all messages could use the `LspProgress` autocmd.\r\n",

So, the intention is for it to be consumed by `lsp.status()` or something similar---purely event-driven, or able to accommodate dropped messages.\r\n\r\nAnd Fidget's current implementation is neither of those: it maintains its state according to its own periodic loop, and requires reliable message delivery. But I can change that! It's pretty straightforward to switch to an `LspProgress` event-driven model.\r\n\r\n> Could fidget create its own dedicated ringbuffer and feed it from LspProgess events?\r\n\r\nMy workaround, where I grow replace the ringbuf with a larger one on `LspAttach`, basically does this, minus a level of indirection.\r\n\r\n> If so, perhaps the LspProgress event data could have a field like overflow: number which says how many items were dropped. Would this help?\r\n\r\nNot really, at least not for my plugin. I guess this could have been helpful for diagnosing Fidget's issue, but it's probably best to keep the interface simple.\r\n\r\nThanks for the discussion!\r\n",
