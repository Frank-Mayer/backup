Neovim currently provides classic syntax highlighting support for [~710 languages](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/master/runtime/syntax), and it costs 8 MiB in total (11 kiB each on average). tree-sitter parsers are 900 kiB on average (between 100–5000 kiB) **each**, so it would cost **639 MiB** if you were to replace them all with tree-sitter. This is insane and unsustainable.\r\n\r\nTherefore tree-sitter should be optional with a graceful fallback to classic syntax highlighting if the tree-sitter for a particular language is not installed. Users can then install tree-sitter parsers only for languages they actively use and for which they want advanced features.

Alpine, as a distro, is focused on small size and security, so that dictates a lot of choices made by packagers.  For example, all documentation is provided in separate `<pkgname>-doc` packages, in order to reduce typical installation and container size.  And when a new Python app is added, all of it's dependencies have to be painstakingly put into their own packages.\r\n\r\nSo, with that philosophy in mind, we generally try to reduce the general amount of things a package requires or pulls over the internet, be it runtime packages or documentation.  So, as long as the original manual filetype configuration files aren't removed from Neovim, using them would be more preferable.\r\n\r\nPackaging tree sitter can indeed cause issues, but such is the toil of the maintainers.  Current Lua TS package, for example, works fine on both Neovim and Helix (with the latter gracefully falling back on no-highlighting if TS isn't present).  So, as long as sticking to a minimal install is possible, we try to do that.\r\n\r\nFinally, with all of that in mind, I (and probably many Neovim users on Alpine) would appreciate it if Neovim would allow bypassing tree sitter as an option, if it's not present at startup.  From my limited understanding, it can be done with a `pcall`, but I haven't yet figured out how to print a diagnostic message[^msg].\r\n\r\n[^msg]: for some reason, `vim.print` doesn't print anything for me if it's located inside an `if`.",

Neovim does not have \"optional dependencies\" or \"optional features\" (this is one of the differentiators from Vim). Let me repeat that for clarity: **there is no \"minimal install\" for Neovim** that is not the full install.\r\n\r\nAnd we use the parsers for more than just syntax highlighting. (I also want to mention that the legacy syntax for Lua specifically has been broken for a long time; as upstream does not see fixing that as a priority -- understandably, since it's a thorny issue and not just a bugged syntax file -- switching to treesitter highlighting was the best option to fix the issue.)\r\n\r\nSo, sorry, the parsers are here to stay and are required for a good reason, so if you package Neovim, you must include them (somehow -- the choice is up to you, but make sure that they are at the exact version specified in our `cmake.deps/deps.txt`, any other version **will** be incompatible). We don't intend to add more in the near future, though.",
