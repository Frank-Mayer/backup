    "body": "Hello there! I'm trying to implement a bit more intuitive cursor position updates in `nvim_buf_set_text`. I looked through the issues and found one which mentions just one case https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22526, which I as well find a bit counterintuitive, though it makes sense in INSERT mode as @bfredl clarified. I left a [comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22526#issuecomment-1693906375) there, suggesting that behavior could probably be different depending on the current mode/window.\r\n\r\nI also described the problem I'm trying to solve within a plugin for code formatting. In short, moving cursors to proper positions after code formatting is a really nice feature, as well as adjusting extmark positions. Fortunately, `nvim_buf_set_text` already does all of that, though not in every case. And I think it would be great if `nvim_buf_set_text` would make of those kinds of adjustments. Based on the issue https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/10096 that seems to be one of the main reasons this api was introduced in the first place.\r\n\r\nRight now I added a couple of test cases (there definitely should be more of them), in which `nvim_buf_set_text` could behave better IMO. And I only implemented a very basic change which roughly addresses first two of them (breaking the next two though :-)). So before I go further, I would like to know if these kinds of changes would be accepted at all, because they are kind of breaking. For example, right now lsp's `apply_text_edits` tests don't pass already with these changes. But I hope that may be in the end explicit cursor adjustments in `apply_text_edits` would not be needed at all, who knows... Otherwise, I'll just dig in and fix the lua code as well.\r\n\r\n@bfredl could you please take a look at the test cases I added and tell me if I should continue fulfilling them and adding more as well?",
