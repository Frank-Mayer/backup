    "body": "Hello there! I'm trying to implement a bit more intuitive cursor position updates in `nvim_buf_set_text`. I looked through the issues and found one which mentions just one case https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22526, which I as well find a bit counterintuitive, though it makes sense in INSERT mode as @bfredl clarified. I left a [comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/22526#issuecomment-1693906375) there, suggesting that behavior could probably be different depending on the current mode/window.\r\n\r\nI also described the problem I'm trying to solve within a plugin for code formatting. In short, moving cursors to proper positions after code formatting is a really nice feature, as well as adjusting extmark positions. Fortunately, `nvim_buf_set_text` already does all of that, though not in every case. And I think it would be great if `nvim_buf_set_text` would make of those kinds of adjustments. Based on the issue https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/10096 that seems to be one of the main reasons this api was introduced in the first place.\r\n\r\nRight now I added a couple of test cases (there definitely should be more of them), in which `nvim_buf_set_text` could behave better IMO. And I only implemented a very basic change which roughly addresses first two of them (breaking the next two though :-)). So before I go further, I would like to know if these kinds of changes would be accepted at all, because they are kind of breaking. For example, right now lsp's `apply_text_edits` tests don't pass already with these changes. But I hope that may be in the end explicit cursor adjustments in `apply_text_edits` would not be needed at all, who knows... Otherwise, I'll just dig in and fix the lua code as well.\r\n\r\n@bfredl could you please take a look at the test cases I added and tell me if I should continue fulfilling them and adding more as well?",

Could you please take a look again?\r\n\r\nNow `col_extent` is only being used for fixing extmarks, logic for cursors does not depend on it's value anymore. Logic for extmarks should probably be changed too, though I'm not sure how exactly. When I tried to blindly apply the same logic, test cases related to extmarks started to fail. IIRC from reading the docs some time ago, it's intended that extmarks behave differently than what you'd expect from cursors. Plus I couldn't figure out what exactly `extmark_splice` is doing inside and what meaning `col_extent` really has there.\r\n\r\nAnd as I expected, most tests for `apply_text_edits` pass even though I removed additional code that was fixing cursors there. One case is still failing though and I'm not sure what to do about it. It fails exactly because of \"cursor gravity\" changes in NORMAL mode. There's an edit being applied, which deletes characters precisely from 0 to cursor column, in which case cursor is shifted to 0 now. Before that change it would not move. I looked at git blame and found that this test was introduced in this PR https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16038. However it seems like it's more concerned about cursor row falling out of bounds, not about column. @hrsh7th do you happen to remember if that was the only reason to add that test case?\r\n\r\nBTW, do I understand correctly that internally cursor column value is expressed in bytes, not in characters?",

If I flip the logic in these changes a bit (in short, mostly by replacing `-`s with `+`s) it would be much more clear that these changes in `nvim_buf_set_text` almost exactly mirror what was in `apply_text_edits`. And IMHO it would be much easier to understand what happens. Right now I left it like this mostly because it seems like similar changes should be applied to extmarks as well, if I figure out how.\r\n\r\nFrom the code it seems like `col_extent` represents how the width of last line has changed. Is that what was intended? Or am I completely wrong? Sorry, I still couldn't figure out what happens in `extmark_splice`.\r\n\r\n> One note regarding nvim_buf_set_text and insert vs normal mode: it might be tempting to use set_text _intentionally_ to insert text at the cursor, but I think we should add a recommendation to use nvim_put at the doc string for this use case, which lets the plugin directly specify if the cursor should be placed before or after the inserted text (\"communicate intent precisely\") .\r\n\r\nYou mean something similar to an existing note \"Prefer |nvim_buf_set_lines()| if you are only adding or deleting entire lines.\"?",

One case is still failing though and I'm not sure what to do about it. It fails exactly because of \"cursor gravity\" changes in NORMAL mode. There's an edit being applied, which deletes characters precisely from 0 to cursor column, in which case cursor is shifted to 0 now. Before that change it would not move. I looked at git blame and found that this test was introduced in this PR https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/16038. However it seems like it's more concerned about cursor row falling out of bounds, not about column. @hrsh7th do you happen to remember if that was the only reason to add that test case?\r\n\r\nYes. My intention was just \"rows going out of bounds\".\r\nI think you are correct in saying \"After deleting the text before the cursor, the cursor should be moved to column 0\".",
