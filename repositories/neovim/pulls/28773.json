To account for this, define all attributes of\n-      highlight groups explicitly. Alternatively, use `:colorscheme vim` or\n-      `:source $VIMRUNTIME/colors/vim.lua` to restore previous definitions.\n-  • 'termguicolors' is enabled by default when Nvim is able to determine that\n-    the host terminal emulator supports 24-bit color.\n-\n-• Editor:\n-  • When switching windows, |CursorMoved| autocommands trigger when Nvim is\n-    back on the main loop rather than immediately. This is more compatible\n-    with Vim.\n-  • \"#\" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start\n-    of the lhs of a mapping.\n-  • |shm-q| now fully hides macro recording message instead of only shortening it.\n-  • Signs placed through the legacy |sign-commands| are now stored and\n-    displayed as |extmarks| internally. Along with the following changes:\n-    • A sign placed twice in the same group with the same identifier will be\n-      moved.\n-    • Legacy signs are always deleted along with the line it is placed on.\n-    • Legacy and extmark signs will show up in both |:sign-place-list| and\n-      |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|.\n-    • Legacy and extmark signs are displayed and listed with the same priority:\n-        line number -> priority -> sign id -> recently placed\n-  • `:behave` was removed.\n-    • If you used `:behave xterm`, the following is equivalent: >vim\n-\n-      set mousemodel=extend\n-<\n-    • If you used `:behave mswin`, the following is equivalent: >vim\n-\n-      set selection=exclusive\n-      set selectmode=mouse,key\n-      set mousemodel=popup\n-      set keymodel=startsel,stopsel\n-<\n-• Events:\n-  • Returning any truthy value from a callback passed to\n-    |nvim_create_autocmd()| (rather than just `true`) will delete the\n-    autocommand.\n-\n-• LSP:\n-  • |LanguageTree:parse()| will no longer parse injections by default and now\n-    requires an explicit range argument to be passed. If injections are\n-    required, provide an explicit range via `parser:parse({ start_row, end_row })`.\n-  • |vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet()| will now strictly follow the snippet\n-    grammar defined by LSP, and hence previously parsed snippets might now be\n-    considered invalid input.\n-  • |vim.lsp.codelens.refresh()| now takes an `opts` argument. With this\n-    change, the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has\n-    been replaced by refreshing all buffers.\n-  • |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()| will no longer return reliable\n-    results, since it does not apply `itemDefaults` when its input is\n-    a `CompletionList`. Moreover, since support for LSP\n-    `completionList.itemDefaults` was added, some third party plugins might be\n-    negatively impacted in case the language servers support the feature but\n-    the plugin does not. If necessary, the respective capability can be\n-    removed when calling |vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()|.\n-  • |LspRequest| and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to |LspProgress|) autocmds\n-    were promoted from |User| autocmds to first class citizens.\n-\n-• Lua:\n-  • |-l| ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and\n-    doesn't cause Nvim to exit.\n-  • Removed functions from the |vim.json| module:\n-    • Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.\n-    • `vim.json.null` is redundant with `vim.NIL`.\n-    • `vim.json.array_mt` (and related) is redundant with `vim.empty_dict()`.\n-  • |vim.islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e., has\n-    integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous behavior\n-    (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1), use\n-    |vim.isarray()|.\n-  • Renamed `vim.treesitter.playground` to `vim.treesitter.dev`.\n-\n-• Options:\n-  • Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:\n-    • 'backspace' no longer supports number values. Instead:\n-      • for `backspace=0` set `backspace=` (empty)\n-      • for `backspace=1` set `backspace=indent,eol`\n-      • for `backspace=2` set `backspace=indent,eol,start` (default behavior in Nvim)\n-      • for `backspace=3` set `backspace=indent,eol,nostop`\n-    • 'backupdir' and 'directory' will no longer remove a `>` at the start of\n-      the option.\n-  • |OptionSet| autocommand args |v:option_new|, |v:option_old|,\n-    |v:option_oldlocal|, |v:option_oldglobal| now have the type of the option\n-    instead of always being strings. |v:option_old| is now the old global\n-    value for all global-local options, instead of just string global-local\n-    options.\n-  • Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when the\n-    option is set (e.g. using |:set| or |nvim_set_option_value()|) without\n-    a scope, which means they now behave the same way as string options.\n-\n-• Plugins:\n-  • |:TOhtml| has been rewritten in Lua to support Nvim-specific decorations,\n-    and many options have been removed.\n-\n-• Treesitter:\n-  • Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with\n-    upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The\n-    full list is documented in |treesitter-highlight-groups|.\n-\n-• TUI:\n-  • In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim |TUI| used to blink even without\n-    configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in |cursor-blinking|. This was a bug\n-    that has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the\n-    following (or similar, adapted to user preference) to your |config| file: >vim\n-      set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500\n-<\n+API\n+\n+• TODO\n+\n+DEFAULTS",

To account for this, define all attributes of\n-      highlight groups explicitly. Alternatively, use `:colorscheme vim` or\n-      `:source $VIMRUNTIME/colors/vim.lua` to restore previous definitions.\n-  • 'termguicolors' is enabled by default when Nvim is able to determine that\n-    the host terminal emulator supports 24-bit color.\n-\n-• Editor:\n-  • When switching windows, |CursorMoved| autocommands trigger when Nvim is\n-    back on the main loop rather than immediately. This is more compatible\n-    with Vim.\n-  • \"#\" followed by a digit no longer stands for a function key at the start\n-    of the lhs of a mapping.\n-  • |shm-q| now fully hides macro recording message instead of only shortening it.\n-  • Signs placed through the legacy |sign-commands| are now stored and\n-    displayed as |extmarks| internally. Along with the following changes:\n-    • A sign placed twice in the same group with the same identifier will be\n-      moved.\n-    • Legacy signs are always deleted along with the line it is placed on.\n-    • Legacy and extmark signs will show up in both |:sign-place-list| and\n-      |nvim_buf_get_extmarks()|.\n-    • Legacy and extmark signs are displayed and listed with the same priority:\n-        line number -> priority -> sign id -> recently placed\n-  • `:behave` was removed.\n-    • If you used `:behave xterm`, the following is equivalent: >vim\n-\n-      set mousemodel=extend\n-<\n-    • If you used `:behave mswin`, the following is equivalent: >vim\n-\n-      set selection=exclusive\n-      set selectmode=mouse,key\n-      set mousemodel=popup\n-      set keymodel=startsel,stopsel\n-<\n-• Events:\n-  • Returning any truthy value from a callback passed to\n-    |nvim_create_autocmd()| (rather than just `true`) will delete the\n-    autocommand.\n-\n-• LSP:\n-  • |LanguageTree:parse()| will no longer parse injections by default and now\n-    requires an explicit range argument to be passed. If injections are\n-    required, provide an explicit range via `parser:parse({ start_row, end_row })`.\n-  • |vim.lsp.util.parse_snippet()| will now strictly follow the snippet\n-    grammar defined by LSP, and hence previously parsed snippets might now be\n-    considered invalid input.\n-  • |vim.lsp.codelens.refresh()| now takes an `opts` argument. With this\n-    change, the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has\n-    been replaced by refreshing all buffers.\n-  • |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()| will no longer return reliable\n-    results, since it does not apply `itemDefaults` when its input is\n-    a `CompletionList`. Moreover, since support for LSP\n-    `completionList.itemDefaults` was added, some third party plugins might be\n-    negatively impacted in case the language servers support the feature but\n-    the plugin does not. If necessary, the respective capability can be\n-    removed when calling |vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()|.\n-  • |LspRequest| and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to |LspProgress|) autocmds\n-    were promoted from |User| autocmds to first class citizens.\n-\n-• Lua:\n-  • |-l| ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and\n-    doesn't cause Nvim to exit.\n-  • Removed functions from the |vim.json| module:\n-    • Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.\n-    • `vim.json.null` is redundant with `vim.NIL`.\n-    • `vim.json.array_mt` (and related) is redundant with `vim.empty_dict()`.\n-  • |vim.islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e., has\n-    integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous behavior\n-    (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1), use\n-    |vim.isarray()|.\n-  • Renamed `vim.treesitter.playground` to `vim.treesitter.dev`.\n-\n-• Options:\n-  • Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:\n-    • 'backspace' no longer supports number values. Instead:\n-      • for `backspace=0` set `backspace=` (empty)\n-      • for `backspace=1` set `backspace=indent,eol`\n-      • for `backspace=2` set `backspace=indent,eol,start` (default behavior in Nvim)\n-      • for `backspace=3` set `backspace=indent,eol,nostop`\n-    • 'backupdir' and 'directory' will no longer remove a `>` at the start of\n-      the option.\n-  • |OptionSet| autocommand args |v:option_new|, |v:option_old|,\n-    |v:option_oldlocal|, |v:option_oldglobal| now have the type of the option\n-    instead of always being strings. |v:option_old| is now the old global\n-    value for all global-local options, instead of just string global-local\n-    options.\n-  • Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when the\n-    option is set (e.g. using |:set| or |nvim_set_option_value()|) without\n-    a scope, which means they now behave the same way as string options.\n-\n-• Plugins:\n-  • |:TOhtml| has been rewritten in Lua to support Nvim-specific decorations,\n-    and many options have been removed.\n-\n-• Treesitter:\n-  • Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with\n-    upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The\n-    full list is documented in |treesitter-highlight-groups|.\n-\n-• TUI:\n-  • In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim |TUI| used to blink even without\n-    configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in |cursor-blinking|. This was a bug\n-    that has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the\n-    following (or similar, adapted to user preference) to your |config| file: >vim\n-      set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500\n-<\n+API\n+\n+• TODO\n+\n+DEFAULTS",

With this\n-    change, the default behavior of just refreshing the current buffer has\n-    been replaced by refreshing all buffers.\n-  • |vim.lsp.util.extract_completion_items()| will no longer return reliable\n-    results, since it does not apply `itemDefaults` when its input is\n-    a `CompletionList`. Moreover, since support for LSP\n-    `completionList.itemDefaults` was added, some third party plugins might be\n-    negatively impacted in case the language servers support the feature but\n-    the plugin does not. If necessary, the respective capability can be\n-    removed when calling |vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities()|.\n-  • |LspRequest| and LspProgressUpdate (renamed to |LspProgress|) autocmds\n-    were promoted from |User| autocmds to first class citizens.\n-\n-• Lua:\n-  • |-l| ensures output ends with a newline if the script prints messages and\n-    doesn't cause Nvim to exit.\n-  • Removed functions from the |vim.json| module:\n-    • Unnecessary, undocumented functions which caused global side-effects.\n-    • `vim.json.null` is redundant with `vim.NIL`.\n-    • `vim.json.array_mt` (and related) is redundant with `vim.empty_dict()`.\n-  • |vim.islist()| now checks whether a table is actually list-like (i.e., has\n-    integer keys without gaps and starting from 1). For the previous behavior\n-    (only check for integer keys, allow gaps or not starting with 1), use\n-    |vim.isarray()|.\n-  • Renamed `vim.treesitter.playground` to `vim.treesitter.dev`.\n-\n-• Options:\n-  • Removed some Vim 5.0<= option compatibilities:\n-    • 'backspace' no longer supports number values. Instead:\n-      • for `backspace=0` set `backspace=` (empty)\n-      • for `backspace=1` set `backspace=indent,eol`\n-      • for `backspace=2` set `backspace=indent,eol,start` (default behavior in Nvim)\n-      • for `backspace=3` set `backspace=indent,eol,nostop`\n-    • 'backupdir' and 'directory' will no longer remove a `>` at the start of\n-      the option.\n-  • |OptionSet| autocommand args |v:option_new|, |v:option_old|,\n-    |v:option_oldlocal|, |v:option_oldglobal| now have the type of the option\n-    instead of always being strings. |v:option_old| is now the old global\n-    value for all global-local options, instead of just string global-local\n-    options.\n-  • Local value for a global-local number/boolean option is now unset when the\n-    option is set (e.g. using |:set| or |nvim_set_option_value()|) without\n-    a scope, which means they now behave the same way as string options.\n-\n-• Plugins:\n-  • |:TOhtml| has been rewritten in Lua to support Nvim-specific decorations,\n-    and many options have been removed.\n-\n-• Treesitter:\n-  • Treesitter highlight groups have been renamed to be more in line with\n-    upstream tree-sitter and Helix to make it easier to share queries. The\n-    full list is documented in |treesitter-highlight-groups|.\n-\n-• TUI:\n-  • In some cases, the cursor in the Nvim |TUI| used to blink even without\n-    configuring 'guicursor' as mentioned in |cursor-blinking|. This was a bug\n-    that has now been fixed. If your cursor has stopped blinking, add the\n-    following (or similar, adapted to user preference) to your |config| file: >vim\n-      set guicursor+=n-v-c:blinkon500-blinkoff500\n-<\n+API\n+\n+• TODO\n+\n+DEFAULTS",
