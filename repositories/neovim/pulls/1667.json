We will need to let it marinate for a few weeks to gather hate mail :)\n\nRegarding Y to y$, quoting the [original objection](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible/issues/47):\n\n> To override settings in vim-sensible, I would have to break my vimrc into two different files in different directories in order to have them load at the correct times. That makes inspection, editing, and deployment of my vimrc on multiple machines rather more complicated\n\nThis doesn't apply to Neovim because we apply these settings before sourcing .nvimrc, so overriding them is comfortable. I think we should map `Y` to `y$`.\n\n> I was also thinking if perhaps some common workarounds would be good to have there too, like this for tmux/screen.\n\nI'm very hesitant to set terminal codes, it's considered bad practice. It should be done in .bashrc, etc. \n",

Two reasons:\n\n1) We ensure these defaults are set if nvim is installed properly. This allows for simplification of some files like we've seen in `evim.vim`, which sustantially becomes [this](https://gist.github.com/fmoralesc/d7f39118932fadbe1d29)\n2) The system admin should feel free to provide some system wide defaults without them being overwritten on updates. \n\nNow, 2) is the weaker argument. The system wide vimrc is mostly unused nowadays like this, and is mostly handled by the distributors. However, having the defaults.vim file be separate and load first in initialization seems more flexible and allows for packagers and system-admins to do whatever they could need.\n",

Given that most languages read left to right (or at least the ones present in nvim's translations), it seems more logical to me to open the split on the right, thereby avoiding moving the initial buffers contents at all, only reducing its right bound before not displaying text (or wrapping, depending on the users vimrc). I think the same could be said for opening splits on the bottom, since most of the languages nvim supports are read top down.\n\nIf a user plans on opening a file which isn't complimentary to their currently open buffer (such as their `~/.vimrc`), then they could just use `:e`. My point is that when opening splits, the initial buffer's position shouldn't be replaced by the new buffer's ones by default, as nvim has no idea whether the second buffer is complementary to the old buffer or not.\n\nAll that might have been a bit convoluted to parse, so I'll provide clarification if needed.\n\nedit: for clarity\n",

It seems like the issues with the tests are gone (possibly because some of the old tests were removed), so I would like to reopen the discussion for the inclusion of this patch into neovim.\n\nAgain, the point of it is to provide a better user experience \"out of the box\", which can help differenciate between vim and nvim (think about the rise in popularity of the fish shell because of its imho no-nonsense approach to defaults.) As to the replacement of the hard coded default settings, we might use the `defaults.vim` file as a guideline as to what needs to be done, if we finally settle on its contents (which I believe are good enough as they are).\n",

But the way the array of options works now, if someone changes the Vim default but forgets  to remove the `P_VI_DEF` flag then Vi's default would still be used. Not going to happen if you're careful of course, but would be prevented completely if there only was one default. Overall it's not a real issue and probably more of an aestetic thing.\n\nThe reason why I looked into this is that I saw that all the `{Not in Vi}` references in the docs were removed. But there are still some options where the different Vi and Vim defaults are documented. So now for some options there is still a reference to Vi, while for most there's not and unclear if that's the case because they aren't in Vi or because the defaults are the same. For consistency, there shouldn't be any references to Vi at all if Vi compatibility is not a goal IMHO. Having vim docs without remarks and references about archaic OSes, vi, the 1000 possible compilation options, etc is definitely something I'm looking forward to in Neovim.\n\nRemoving documentation for a feature that's still there seemed a bit wrong, so I wanted to do both...\n",

We removed compatibility for specific things where the cost of keeping them outweighed the benefit. \n- We removed nocp because it will allow us to remove numerous code paths which exist only to match Vi bug-for-bug. \n  - The \"options profile\" known as `&vi` is not such a code path. It's just a pre-defined set of _options that we support_. Removal of this preset doesn't remove any testable code path, nor does it reduce surface area, potential for bugs, or user pain.\n- We removed Vi references in the documentation where it made sense to do so. But it is not a goal _per se_ to remove all mentions of Vi.\n\n> We've already broken compatibility on a decent number of things which were arguably useless and/or misfeatures (edcompatible, crypto support, among other things in vim_diff.txt), so I don't see why this should be an exception.\n\nThe fact that we broke compatibility in some cases should not be interpreted as a \"slippery slope\". Each case was measured and justified. Presumably the cost was less than the benefit. \n\n> clarify why you're okay with doing that, but not with removing `&vi`\n\nI'm not opposed to removing `&vi`, but there is zero reason to do it _right now_. It's not a time-sensitive task: we don't gain anything by removing it now--_and_ we currently lack data on whether it will break plugins. Given that the time-sensitivity is zero, and the risk is greater than zero, that means there is negative reason in favor of doing it until after we have more users.\n\nOn the other hand, some tasks _must_ and _should_ be done _before_ the first release.\n\nI am also not in favor of removing any `'cpoption'` that has the same risk:benefit ratio as `&vi`.\n",
