It will be pretty easy to find an example where it doesn't work if the user doesn't have a well spaced out terminal colorscheme.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I've added an example that uses 16 colors with the new Nvim palette in addition to what it looks like with my terminal theme which I've put a lot of time into.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly the comparison with my github palette is a bit brighter than default but I consider it far from unusable and overall I generally much prefer it. If we go this route, I'll probably just tweak my green color to be a little darker. This will make diff in the CLI nicer too.\r\n\r\nThere are still some colors we could tweak, but so far I think this is pretty good.",

Leave it as it is, i.e. use only 16-255 colors in `cterm*` to have the curated default palette. This has the advantage of not *depending* on user terminal config and providing uniform experience for new users. The disadvantage is that is does not use terminal config and can not provide tailored user experience.\r\n2. Make `termguicolors` default and have curated default `gui` palette. This will provide a uniform experience for new users with terminals capable of true color.\r\n    At the same time treat `cterm*` as \"emergency option\" for terminals which do not support true color. I.e. no condition on it to [look like this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14790#issuecomment-927200052), to have \"good UI\", etc. Then it opens a door to a more natural usage of only 8 colors: 7 for foreground and only single background color. This allows eliminating the problem of contrast by relying only on a single assumption of \"Red, green, yellow, blue, cyan, magenta, and foreground can be used as foreground with a single base background\" (which I feel is quite common). If bold, underline, and reverse `cterm` are allowed, then it can be a reasonably not bad looking UI by \"emergency exit\" standards.\r\n\r\nI personally prefer option 1, but option 2 (with `termguicolors` and curated color scheme being default) is also fine for me.",

Indeed, if there are only 3 highlighted colors it might not worth much. I guess I'd *slightly* prefer `ctermfg=NONE ctermbg=NONE cterm=reverse` instead of `ctermfg=0 ctermbg=7 cterm=NONE` for `Visual`, but it is not a hard preference at all. Should I include the second one in the future work?\r\n\r\nOne problem with the second approach would be that it will be a visual language for `Pmenu`, floating windows and active statusline/tabline. So maybe having simple `cterm=reverse` is a good idea to balance things out?",
