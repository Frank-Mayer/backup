Specifically I'm wondering why we didn't do this before, and instead use the `g:terminal_color_` thing. And why does `g:terminal_color_` only work for truecolor?\r\n\r\n@teto Somewhat related, I noticed Vim added a [color2index](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/6daeef1933be68055aabe1d55f8467d46a707753/src/terminal.c#L1716) function which translates from RGB to cterm colors.
