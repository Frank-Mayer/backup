(I haven't analyzed the codepaths involved.)\r\n\r\nSo I tried to do this in `os_open()` in `os/fs.c` first, but it is too late to do it there because `fix_fname()` has already converted the path to an absolute path to a relative `~` directory, this is why I put it there.\r\n\r\n> I had heard differently in another issue.

Can you provide a reference (which should have been mentioned from the start, in the PR description)\r\n\r\nThere used to be an experimental feature for this in `get-experimentalfeature` that you could enable, I don't remember which exactly, but it has been removed.\r\n\r\nIn the unreleased development version of PowerShell, which may not be released for quite a while yet, there is an experimental feature for this, `PSNativeWindowsTildeExpansion`, see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/experimental-feature-windows.json).",

I think I know how to do this now.\r\n\r\n- Fix `vim_isAbsName()` in `path.c` to return true for paths with a tilde expansion, because they are in fact absolute paths, this way `fix_fname()` in `path.c` will not \"fix\" them.\r\n- Perform the expansion in `os_open()` in `os/fs.c` using a helper function on both UNIX and Windows.\r\n\r\nI want to handle `~username/` expansions as well, this may be of use to admin users. This is much harder to do on Windows and I may not be able to fully support it, but I will try for at least partial support.\r\n\r\nIf you don't like this idea I will go with your solution of putting the expansion in `main.c` because that does in fact fix the main problem I am trying to fix.",

Neovim would probably not function correctly at all in that case.\r\n\r\nIf it does happen that it is not available in some situation we can deal with that separately, I think.\r\n\r\nThis code is in `os/env.c`, `os_homedir()` gets the homedir from libuv, `init_homedir()` sets `homedir` from `os_homedir()` while `vim_getenv(\"HOME\")` returns `homedir`. So this is essentially the same thing.\r\n\r\nI should mention that I did test this and it does work as intended.\r\n\r\n> Also needs test coverage.\r\n\r\nI will do a separate PR for that.\r\n\r\n> But I'm confused about why this is needed, because https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/23901#issuecomment-2033479836 indicated that powershell would provide this feature without every program needing to implement it manually.\r\n\r\nIt is currently a major usability issue.\r\n\r\nFor many PowerShell users, `nvim` is the native program they will most often call with tilde paths.\r\n\r\nSomeone mentioned that tab completion for tilde paths may be backported to the full expansion behavior, but it is unknown whether and when that will happen. And that would still require tab expansion.\r\n\r\nThis will also work in WinPS (`powershell.exe`, version 5) which will not be updated for a very long time to come. It does expand tilde paths with tab, but this will work without expansion.\r\n\r\nIt may also be helpful for people using other shells, I don't know.\r\n\r\nThe experimental feature for handling tilde path arguments to native programs in the development branch of PowerShell will most likely not be available for months to come, and even then it may only be available as an experimental feature that requires it to be enabled manually.\r\n\r\nGiven that this is not a large change, and does not break anything, I think it's justified, given that it is a major usability issue for Windows users.\r\n\r\nYou may consider PowerShell not handling tilde paths itself like a UNIX shell absolutely ridiculous, and I agree, but that is the situation we are in.",
