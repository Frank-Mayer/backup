Every start plugin gets added to &rtp at startup. For this  `nvim_get_runtime()`/`:runtime` maybe other stuff to gets double hit once for being in rtp and once for being in packpath/start . You can try it out yourself . put something like\r\n```lua\r\nprint('ran')\r\n```\r\nin `stdpath('config')/pack/random_name/start/some_plugin/my_uniq_file_in_rtp.lua`\r\n\r\nRestart nvim .Then run `:runtime! my_uniq_file_in_rtp.lua` . you'll see ran printed twice. Same goes for nvim_get_runtime_file it returns same location twice .\r\n\r\nBut if you put that command in your init.vim/lua it'll print only once for being in packpath/start . I think runtime searching in packpath/start was added because start plugins aren't available in rtp when user config runs . Causing tons of issues.\r\n\r\nI feel like runtime should only check rtp and start plugins should be put into rtp earlier in intialization (before init.vim/lua) so it's not necessary to check in start for files for startup.\r\n\r\ncc @bfredl @justinmk \r\n\r\nThough I haven't looked at that portion of codebase .\r\nThese are just what I thought from external test results. @bfredl will know better why this happens :]",

What happens to that if you avoid start plugins in rtp?\r\n\r\nIn general, when I say something should be done for \"start packages\" it means the opt package behavior is unchanged. and keeping the behavior of `:packadd opt_package` of add it to `&rtp` seems like a good baseline (unless people expect to add hundreds of opt packages in the same session for some reason).",
