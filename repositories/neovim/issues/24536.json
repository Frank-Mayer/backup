In my terminal I see the values that direnv added to my path at the front of the list, but from within the Neovim terminal I see them near the middle of the list.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this without Neovim, just by running an instance of my shell from within my terminal:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $PATH\r\nfish\r\necho $PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know how to improve the use of direnv from within a Neovim terminal, but I'm glad I've finally figured out what's causing the issue (it's been bugging me for a while).\r\n\r\nEdit: Here's a crude workaround:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"TermOpen\", {\r\n\tcallback = function()\r\n\t\tvim.cmd.startinsert()\r\n\t\tlocal direnv_status = vim.fn.system({ \"direnv\", \"status\" })\r\n\t\tif direnv_status:find(\"Found RC path\") then\r\n\t\t\tvim.api.nvim_input(\"direnv reload<cr>\")\r\n\t\tend\r\n\tend,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit 2: Found some discussions about this: https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/614\r\n\r\nEdit 3: Here's another option: `vim.o.shell = \"direnv exec / fish\"`  \r\n(https://github.com/direnv/direnv/issues/614#issuecomment-749762665)\r\n\r\nEdit 4: `vim.o.shell = \"direnv exec / fish\"` appears to wipe out changes to the env made by plugins; in my case, mason adding its `bin` directory to the path.",
