After I start term, I have to manually do a direnv reload.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. cd a_project_with_direnv_and_nix_flake\r\n2. which cargo\r\n> /nix/store/lnp941j5cghl6lg5ryfl0gnh8795mavn-rust-default-1.72.0-nightly-2023-06-16/bin/cargo\r\n3. open term in nvim\r\n4. which cargo\r\n> ~/.nix-profile/bin/cargo\n\n### Expected behavior\n\ncargo should be on in step 2 and step 4\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nfedora 38(macos has this behaviour also)\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20230712-072601-f4abf8fd\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nnix-env -i nvim",

E.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvim\r\n:terminal\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou also did not mention which env vars weren't inherited, but based on `which cargo` I guess direnv sets $PATH.\r\n\r\n\"env vars aren't inherited\" sounds like the wrong diagnosis:  Nvim certainly inherits all env vars, this is a basic behavior.\r\n\r\nthis is most likely a misconfiguration of your 'shellcmdflag' option or something like that.
