Per the [spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#completionItem), `insertTextMode` is optional but not nullable.\r\n\r\nDiscovered [here](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/3842). The Haskell Language Server is quite strict about spec compliance, so it fails here.\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nI don't know, I don't use neovim.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nI don't know, the reporter didn't specify\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nI don't know, the reporter didn't specify\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
