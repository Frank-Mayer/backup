In https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/18476#issuecomment-1120390374, @mfussenegger mentioned:\r\n\r\n>:lsp / :LspInfo: LspInfo currently does more than just printing all clients, it also prints all not started yet. It can do that because lsp-config currently includes the \"managing clients\" functionality. I think the first step we have to do to bring anything like that into core is to move the manager component.\r\n\r\nNvim core would need the concept of \"registering\" or \"managing\" a client without it being started. For example, a `vim.lsp.register` API that makes Nvim aware of a client configuration without actually starting it. This same functionality would be needed for `:LspStart` as well, if we want to include that.\r\n\r\nI do not think we should include `:LspInfo` directly, but its functionality should be integrated into `:checkhealth lsp`.\r\n\r\nIf we do add `:LspStart` and/or `:LspStop`, I propose they be added as `:lsp start` and `:lsp stop` and promote `:lsp` to a first class command (note, this is a different interface thn the one proposed in #18476).\r\n\r\ncc @mfussenegger ",
