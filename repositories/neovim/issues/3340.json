I believe that this should be considered a bug because if terminals are buffers, they should behave as buffers under most circumstances (without surprising a reasonably experienced user) and this unloading is a bit unexpected.

I think it's a really nice feature to have a terminal buffer that I'm able to interact with within nvim, but if the application running in it (an ssh session for instance, or some interactive console) may be killed because it's not in a window, it defeats at least the purpose I use it for. Restarting the shell would therefore also not be useful.\n\nI guess that people will use this differently, so configurability is probably the way forward. However, killing terminal sessions is not a desired default behaviour.\n",

Though https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6280 seems like a more proper fix.\r\n\r\n> what we should do with terminal buffers for `'nohidden'`: should we ignore `'nohidden'` and keep the terminal running (this is contrary to the normal operation of `'nohidden'`)?\r\n\r\nThat's still an open question.\r\n\r\nBut the main issue here appears to be resolved.",
