    "body": "### Problem\n\nIn my Neovim config (`init.lua`), I have the following line:\r\n```lua\r\nvim.o.mouse = nil\r\n```\r\nWhen I was using nvim 0.9.5, this would properly change the value of `mouse` (verifiable with `:set mouse?` printing `mouse=`).\r\n\r\nHowever, in nvim 0.10, this no longer works. `mouse` is set to `nvi` despite this line remaining in my config (verifiable with `:set mouse?` printing `mouse=nvi`). I can run `:set mouse=` in every new Neovim instance, but this seems like a regression. For what it's worth, running `:lua vim.o.mouse = nil` doesn't change anything even in a Neovim instance, although `:lua print(vim.o.mouse)` does reflect the latest change made by `:set mouse`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create `minimal.lua` as:\r\n    ```lua\r\n    vim.o.mouse = nil\r\n    ```\r\n2. Run `nvim --clean -u minimal.lua`\r\n3. In Neovim, run `:set mouse?`\r\n4. Observe that `mouse=nvi`\r\n\r\nThe same steps with Neovim 0.9.5 have `mouse=`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim 0.10.0 should continue to allow you to set `mouse` using `vim.o.mouse`, or, if not, there should be a clear migration path to continue setting this configuration option in Lua\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nnvim v0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.13.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nNixpkgs",
