Kitty may soon support it too: https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/pull/1454\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be amazing if Neovim could work with the terminal so that this occurs whenever a command scrolls, e.g.,\r\n* ctrl-d, ctrl-u (page down and up),\r\n* zz (rehome)\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nI've noticed that the Kitty creator has in various other threads been open to providing the necessary interface for working with various applications.  So I think you could get buy-in from the terminal.\r\n\r\nThis would be a huge visual improvement for NeoVim over other text editors :smile: ",
