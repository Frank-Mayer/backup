One use case would be implementing GotoDefinition from the popup window.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen in the popup window with a cursor the `vim.lsp.util.make_position_params` function would report the position in the temporary file. The file would not be opened as a new buffer but in the popup window.",
