Set your region to some place which doesn't have an English variant (e.g Norway)\r\n2. Set your language to English\r\n3. Start nvim\r\n4. Check the `LANG` env var, e.g by running `:echo $LANG`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe $LANG env var should be set to a valid locale, such as `en_US.UTF-8` (or it could be left empty for all I care, it just shouldn't be invalid)\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe $LANG env var is set to the invalid `en_NO.UTF-8` string. There is no \"norwegian-english\" language.\r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic when using the terminal mode (`:terminal`). All perl programs, for example, show a huge ugly locale error.",

And for _all_ mac users who otherwise have a setup where CoreFoundation doesn't give you a locale which works with \"LANG\". I don't really think that's as unproblematic as you're suggesting it is.\r\n\r\nAlso, is the current behavior even correct? Does nvim expect pbpaste to return UTF-8 which nvim then converts to the correct encoding, or does nvim just assume that whatever pbpaste returns matches the encoding of the file?\r\n\r\nAnd if nvim expects pbpaste to return UTF-8, wouldn't a more targeted solution be to set `LANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"` when running pbpaste instead of setting it the locale globally for the whole application and all child processes?\r\n\r\nOr, maybe we could use another env var? I'm looking at the man page for `pbpaste`, it doesn't mention LANG, just that it uses \"environment variables\". I would expect it to use LC_CTYPE by default, which on my system is set to UTF-8 out of the box.",
