I only fixed a typo in the docs!\")\r\n4. these checks do not test actual editor functionality (instead just use it for other purposes), so don't actually use the testing harness (in fact, a straight-up `nvim -l` shebang script would be simpler).\r\n\r\n(It's also not exactly intuitive that the help file validation function is part of the HTML generator script, but here there's at least the code reuse argument.)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMove these checks from the functionaltest target into a separate linting job (\"validate help files\").",

I was thinking we may want to move many of the lint checks from `scripts/` into a new `test/lint/` test suite. That allows the lint checks to reuse various testutils and conventions. Thoughts?",
