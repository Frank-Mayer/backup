    "body": "This is a request for comments for my project [Neoclip](https://github.com/matveyt/neoclip).\r\n\r\nAs we all know, Neovim had dropped all system-specific code to access clipboard. While it was a flexible design, but it led to several common problems the users seem to encounter all the time: need for extra utlities or specific GUIs; poor performance under some circumstances; unreliable detection of Visual-Blocks and such. There were some attempts to resolve this problem, like [this](https://github.com/bfredl/nvim-x11) or [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12452), but none is complete and ready for use.\r\n\r\nSo I present my solution: it is a plugin and several binary extension modules for major platforms providing uniform API to access system clipboard. The project state is as follows:\r\n\r\n+ multi-platform: Windows, macOS, X11 and Wayland;\r\n+ pure plugin, no patches to Neovim needed;\r\n+ only essential dependencies, such as wayland-client; no special utilities, GUIs, fat toolkits etc.\r\n+ Vim-compatible custom clipboard formats for all platforms; able to detect Visual-Blocks;\r\n+ X11: support for rare features like INCR; can paste >256K from Gtk apps;\r\n- No binaries at the moment, so user must build from source\r\n- Not enough testing and user experience;\r\n- Wayland: [wlr-data-control](https://wayland.app/protocols/wlr-data-control-unstable-v1) protocol is required; if it's not available (for example, GNOME/Mutter) Neoclip falls back to X11 module;\r\n\r\nSo I'd be glad to get any feedback from all of you. If you think it's a good addition to your plugin collection; or maybe it's even worth shipping Neoclip as default plugin with Neovim runtime; or maybe you can spot some bugs and so on.\r\n\r\nThank you!",
