I'd like to be able to perform commands on column- and line-wise ranges. There are more examples in the Stack overflow post, but I find it odd that [the vim help pages](https://vimhelp.org/visual.txt.html#%3Avisual_example) talk about line-based ranges as though column-based ranges were planned in the future:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t*:visual_example*\r\nCurrently the \":\" command works on whole lines only.  When you select part of\r\na line, doing something like \":!date\" will replace the whole line.  If you\r\nwant only part of the line to be replaced you will have to make a mapping for\r\nit.  In a future release \":\" may work on partial lines.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there any tracking issue for the comment \"In a future release \":\" may work on partial lines\"? If not, I felt there should be one. It would be a big help.\r\n\r\nThere is a plugin that partially solves this: [vis](https://github.com/vim-scripts/vis), although it's not as ergonomic as it could be.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf a block of text were selected using `ctrl-v` (or even just a part of a line of text), then pressing `:` should auto-fill the partial-line range selector: ```:`<,`>``` instead of it's current behaviour, which auto-fills the line-based range selector: `:'<,'>`. I'm not sure if it's feasible (or possible) to migrate all line-based commands to the new selector.",

Use {line}.{column} notation in an Ex\r\n    range, e.g.: \":1.3,$.5s\" means to substitute from line 1 column 3 to the\r\n    last line column 5.\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this could be for all commands, not just `:s`. And I agree that backtick mark notation should work charwise:\r\n\r\n```\r\n:`<,`>foo\r\n:`a,`bfoo\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that charwise is different than blockwise. Would need some way to disambiguate that.",

I'd say \"done\" for charwise is:\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\n- Support backtick ranges pass column info to the command\r\n  ```\r\n  :`<,`>foo\r\n  :`a,`bfoo\r\n  ```\r\n    - Note: it's vaguely possible that parsing a backtick range might conflict with `:help backtick-expansion`. Probably isn't an issue because `:help backtick-expansion` does not happen in the \"range\" part (the start) of a command.\r\n- Column info is available as `<col1>` , `<col2>` (like `:help <line1>`) \r\n    - For user-defined command, `:command -addr=lines`\r\n- Support \"x.y\" ranges pass column info to the command\r\n  ```\r\n  :1.2,2.2 foo\r\n  ```\r\n- Update `nvim_parse_cmd()` , `nvim_cmd()`\r\n- Add charwise support to a few common Ex commands:\r\n    - `:read`\r\n    - `:write`\r\n    - `:substitute`\r\n    - `:global`\r\n    - ...\r\n    - Document the rest.\r\n- Update docs: `:help :range`, ",
