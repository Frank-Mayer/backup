    "body": "### Problem\n\nTo use \"plugins\" or \"extensions\", we have to manually write code to configure a plugin manager in our rc file and specify where to get plugins/extensions from in a non-standard way (typically from git repos).\r\n\r\nWhile this works,\r\n\r\n- it is more cumbersome than something like the built-in plugin manager in VS Code\r\n- it is error prone\r\n- there's no official registry to catalogue plugins out of the box\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhat would be sweet is if Neovim has a built-in plugin manager and a registry, making it as easy to use out-of-the-box as plugins in VS Code.\r\n\r\nIn VS Code, you activate the plugin UI, search or browse for a plugin, then hit the install button.\r\n\r\nNeovim could offer something similar out-of-the-box, but with a TUI by default. GUI frontends for Neovim could hook into the API to offer even better UIs.\r\n\r\nThe advantages would be:\r\n\r\n- easily discover plugins from a registry (or some system that catalogues them from github or somewhere)\r\n  - The (T/G)UI would be able to also offer ways of exploring plugins (like VS Code) such as filters for installed, workspace-only, themes, language-specific, votes, downloads, etc.\r\n- easily install them\r\n- don't worry about programming a plugin manager and making mistakes\r\n- Neovim becomes customizeable in a way that is more approachable and easier out-of-the-box for newcomers to Vim world (while rc configuration would still work as-is).",
