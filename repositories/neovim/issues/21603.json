The decorations could be anything, but in practice they tend to be SVGs of different colors that are placed on top of characters to allow the user to reference a particular element with minimal work. Cursorless is most widely used by the voice coding community. See [this gif](https://github.com/cursorless-dev/cursorless/blob/1a0616521bbc6d264f22fdad41e9a7773f9b0bee/images/bringArgueAirAndEachAfterDrum.gif) for an example of what the text decorations look like.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if neovim GUIs could support this type of text decoration, but I imagine it will require some server side changes.\r\n\r\nCross linking some related issues for posterity:\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1767\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/1144\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/669\r\n- https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/850\r\n\r\n",
