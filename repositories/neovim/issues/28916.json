My preference would be to use the default colorscheme shipped with 0.10 as the palette, as it provides a unified look and it has a better readability. Barring that, something like Chris Kempson's 'default dark' (recent Alacritty's switched to this from Tomorrow Night) is battle-tested and works better than the default xterm palette.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
