    "body": "### Problem\n\nI would like to test a neovim plugin in github CI. The problem is that it seems to hang waiting for me to hit enter after a message is displayed. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be nice to have a way to disable requiring to hit enter entirely for any message being displayed so it doesn't block in CI environment where no user interaction is possible.\r\n\r\nI am aware of the \"shortmess\" option https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#%27shortmess%27 but it doesn't seem possible to disable them all for sure, at least it didn't seem to help me.\r\n\r\nThere is the noice plugin https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim that allows redirecting messages to notifications and it has the nice side effect of not requiring me to hit enter but it means installing an additional plugin just for that in CI to get a feature that could be nice to have in neovim itself.
