Also see |++opt| and |+cmd|.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe documentation explicitly says `:next` works with a count, so the fact that `vim.cmd.next({count=1})` doesn't work should be considered a bug, even if it is \"technically working\".\r\n\r\nThe confusion is exacerbated by the fact that `nvim_parse_cmd('1previous', #{})` _does_ show `{count: 1}`!\r\n\r\nThe core question is: why does `nvim_parse_cmd` return `range: [1]` instead of `count: 1` for some commands, but not others?",
