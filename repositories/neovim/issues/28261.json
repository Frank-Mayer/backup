In other words, LSP is doing its job to provide the superset of data and then a client can decide how to use the whole thing, or a subset of the data. But if the LSP instead transformed the data or made the decision on moving the inlay hints to a different position, all clients would be at the mercy of the LSP decision. Is this your overall point?\n\nI see both sides 🤔 I have a feeling that means the unfortunate solution is going to be someone needing to create a Plugin to implement this behavior.",
