This is already listed as a caveat in `:h CTRL-D/U`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe cursor is moved the same number of\r\nlines down in the file (if possible; when lines wrap\r\nand when hitting the end of the file there may be a\r\ndifference).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current logic aims to keep the cursor on the same screen line, this is definitely wanted for 'smoothscroll'. And since the current behavior is already documented (albeit not totally backwards compatible), I'm not sure if this needs to be changed. If anything I think the new behavior better matches the current help text: \"the same number of lines\" is not 'scroll' when close to the start/end of the buffer. Pressing CTRL-D/U one more time at the boundaries will still move the cursor to the start/end.",
