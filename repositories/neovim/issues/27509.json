We currently do not enable this mode and termkey is not currently able to parse these events, but we certainly could.\r\n\r\nA possible use case for press/release events would be to show a floating window only while a key is held down (e.g. for LSP hover or diagnostics).\r\n\r\nAdding support to libtermkey is fairly straightforward (I already have a working prototype in a branch). The more difficult problem is plumbing this into Neovim's own event handling.\r\n\r\nAt least one question is how a press/release event should be represented. The TUI sends all key events to the core with `nvim_input`, so we need a way to represent the \"press\"/\"release\" event there. We should be able to leave \"press\" events as-is and only add special casing for \"release\" events (I'm not sure we need \"repeat\" events?).\r\n\r\nWe could limit press/release events only to the API (via `nvim_set_keymap`) so that we don't need to modify `:map` and friends.\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/14400",
