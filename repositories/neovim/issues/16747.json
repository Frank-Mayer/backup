    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\r\n\r\nYes, Vim 8.1.1406 added `popup_hide()` and `popup_show()`.\r\n\r\n### Feature description\r\n\r\nThis feature request is for adding functionality for hiding, showing, and checking hidden status of floating windows. This would be similar to `popup_hide()`, `popup_show()`, and `popup_getpos().visible` in Vim.\r\n\r\nThis would permit plugins to temporarily hide their own floating windows, or temporarily hide other floating windows that interfere with their functionality. My motivation for this feature request is from a plugin I wrote that uses ordinary windows for its interface, where existing floating windows can interfere (https://github.com/dstein64/vim-menu/issues/1).\r\n\r\nI suppose functionality for hiding floating windows—when kept hidden—could exacerbate Issue #11440 and Issue #13628 since the current error messages would be particularly confusing when they arise from floating windows that are hidden.",
