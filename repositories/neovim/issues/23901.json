It's a huge annoyance for me in PowerShell because I run these commands frequently and now I have to run a command such as:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nnvim (gi ~/.ssh/config)\r\n```\r\n, instead to get the file I want.\r\n\r\nThere used to be an experimental feature for this in `get-experimentalfeature` that you could enable, I don't remember which exactly, but it has been removed.\r\n\r\nIn the unreleased development version of PowerShell, which may not be released for quite a while yet, there is an experimental feature for this, `PSNativeWindowsTildeExpansion`, see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/experimental-feature-windows.json).\r\n\r\nI believe it would be better if we address this in neovim, because this PowerShell experimental feature will not be available for a while yet, and when it is it would require enabling it, and if this is done in neovim it would also work in WinPS (`powershell.exe`) and `cmd.exe`.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that the PowerShell completion behavior for tilde paths has also recently changed. Before, when you would type:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nnvim ~/.ssh/config<TAB>\r\n```\r\n, it would expand to the absolute path, but PowerShell no longer expands tilde paths to absolute paths, it expands them to canonical tilde paths, leading to the behavior in neovim that I described.\r\n\r\nI tried to do this in `os_open()` in `os/fs.c` first, but it is too late to do it there because `fix_fname()` has already converted the path to an absolute path to a relative `~` directory, this is why I put it there.",
