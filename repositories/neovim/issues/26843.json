    "body": "### Problem\n\nThe viewport here is the visible lines in the Neovim window. By leaving the viewport I mean any action which moves the cursor outside the viewport, for example:\r\n* Navigating to the next search occurrence (`n` or `N`).\r\n* Navigating to the LSP definition/declaration or any other symbol.\r\n* `C-o` and `C-i`.\r\n* `cnext` and `cprev`\r\n* and many others\r\n\r\nThe editor behavior when you leave the viewport is quite chaotic - sometimes the cursor is in the top of the window, sometimes in the bottom, other times somewhere in the middle. This is a little disorienting because after each such action, you need a moment to locate the cursor on the screen.\r\n\r\nMany folks override mappings for `n` and `N` to do `n` and `zz`, others are also doing this for LSP navigation, [example](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/kxoyxt/centering_screen_after_lsp_definition/). \r\n\r\nCould this behavior be provided by Neovim itself? Hopefully, it could be implemented in a single place rather than handled for each case separately in the user configs.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen the cursor is moved outside of the current viewport (visible lines in the current window), center the window vertically (`zz`). This should apply to all cases except for certain exclusion list: moving the cursor with `hjkl`, `C-d/C-u`, and some others. If there is a general interest in this behavior, we could compile a full list.\r\n\r\nThis behavior could be enabled by a new option.",
