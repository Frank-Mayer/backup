I have not dug into it too much, as previously stated, but have noticed it mostly related to `:term` and/or jobstart usage (e.g. toggleterm). This I cannot repro consistently.\r\n\r\nWhat I can repro consistently is doing a `:Lazy` will cause neovim to freeze and I have to pkill it.\r\n\r\nI opened [this issue](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim/issues/1135) in lazy.nvim, but I don't know for sure that lazy is to blame.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`:Lazy`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNeovim does not freeze\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-2c9f22e\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNot sure\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nNixOS 23.11.20230917.5148520 (Tapir)\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nkitty 0.29.2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-kitty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nnix via willruggiano/neovim.drv",
