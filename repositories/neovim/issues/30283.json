    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nMemory that is consumed by Lua code and subsequently freed by an automatic garbage collection cycle or manually with `collectgarbage(\"collect\")` often doesn't result in the memory used being released back to the operating system. This causes Neovim to use more memory than necessary, even after memory intensive code has finished running.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this issue is that when a plugin such as Telescope is used to search a large project multiple times (which is a normal use case), the memory usage will climb to many times what is necessary, and will remain high even after the user has finished searching and the results no longer need to be kept in memory. I have seen memory usage climb up to and exceed 1 GB because of this issue (although typically excess memory usage is around 100-500 MB).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Launch Neovim with `nvim --clean`\r\n2. Run the following commands and monitor memory usage with a system monitor, leaving 5-10 second gaps between each execution:\r\n   `:lua local nums = {} for i = 1, 10000000 do nums[i]=i end vim.g.foo = nums`\r\n   [repeat the previous command two more times]\r\n   `:lua vim.g.foo = nil`\r\n   `:lua collectgarbage(\"collect\")`\r\n   `:lua print(collectgarbage(\"count\"))`\r\n3. Memory usage should have increased to around 1.4 GB, then decreased to around 960 MB, where it remains. The output of the last command should show that only around 323 KB of memory remains in use by Lua, even though the Neovim process is still using 960 MB.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nMemory usage by the Neovim process should be released or begin decreasing soon after it is no longer in use by Lua.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-714+g220b8aa6f\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux with kernel 6.9.3\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nAlacritty 0.13.2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nalacritty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nappimage",

Try the following script:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal function test(kind, n)\r\n  local var = 'nums' .. n\r\n  vim.v.testing = 1\r\n  local before = collectgarbage('count')\r\n  collectgarbage('collect')\r\n  vim.fn.test_garbagecollect_now() -- vim.fn.garbagecollect()\r\n\r\n  if kind == 'vim-bridge' then\r\n    local nums = {}\r\n    for i = 1, 90000000 do nums[i]=i end\r\n    vim.g[var] = nums\r\n  elseif kind == 'lua-only' then\r\n    _G[var] = {}\r\n    for i = 1, 90000000 do _G[var][i]=i end\r\n  else\r\n    error()\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  -- GC\r\n  _G[var] = nil\r\n  vim.g[var] = nil\r\n  -- vim.cmd[[unlet g:nums]]\r\n  collectgarbage('collect')\r\n  vim.fn.test_garbagecollect_now() -- vim.fn.garbagecollect()\r\n  local after = collectgarbage('count')\r\n  vim.cmd.echomsg(([['memory increase/decrease after gc (%s): %f%%']]):format(kind, ((after - before)/before) * 100))\r\nend\r\n\r\ntest('lua-only', '1')\r\ntest('lua-only', '2')\r\ntest('lua-only', '3')\r\ntest('lua-only', '4')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '1')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '2')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '3')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '4')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '5')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '6')\r\n-- test('vim-bridge', '7')\r\n\r\n-- vim: sw=2 et\r\n```\r\n\r\nTesting on macOS with `nvim --clean test.lua`,\r\n\r\n- all `test('lua-only', n)` calls always result in memory usage returning to the \"zero level\" (usage at startup before running the script).\r\n- each call to `test('vim-bridge', n)` increases memory usage by 1 GB for each `n`.\r\n    - `:unlet g:nums...` doesn't help (and `vim.g.nums...=nil` should be equivalent anyway).",

I also observed that memory usage seems to be around half when using `_G.foo` as opposed to `vim.g.foo` before the call to `collectgarbage`.\r\n\r\nI suspect there is still some other issue even when not using the vim-bridge since the Telescope plugin still has this issue with memory not being released, and that doesn't use `vim.g` to store its results. I'll need to have a closer look regarding that to see if there's a simple Lua reproduction I can come up with.",
