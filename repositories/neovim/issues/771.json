They have sections on:\n- Changes on the `master` branch.\n- Other changes.\n- New contributors.\n- A list of RFCs, Request for Comments.\n- Community Updates.\n\nOther possible sections:\n- Highlighting those that have donated for transparency (@tarruda and I have talked about this).\n- New bounties.\n\nSome things that I'd like comments on:\n- Is this something you'd like to see? Would it be beneficial to the community?\n- How often would you like it? Weekly? Every other week (bi-monthly)? Monthly?\n- Any other suggestions on what could be featured?\n- Where should it live? If it should be separate from Neovim proper, I have no problem with that; that's how This Week in Rust is ran. Some guy just hosts it on his blog.\n\nAlso, I don't want it to interfere with the development in anyway so I won't ask for any of the main developers time for obvious reasons. My goal is purely for community engagement & transparency with the people that have supported Neovim in various ways.\n\nThanks everyone =]\n",

The pace of reportable development tends to differ from month to month, so monthly might be ok. The way I usually prefer to get news from projects I follow is by subscribing to their RSS feeds with [newsbeuter](http://www.newsbeuter.org/). That way it doesn't clutter my mailbox either and I can \"pull\" news when I have the time instead of having to mark it as \"read-later\" or get annoyed that it's there while I have work to do. So maybe we could post these monthly oversights to the website and have each post reflected in an RSS feed?\n",

That is necessary, as a way for us to study/understand current code, and more importantly, to enable more people to more easily understand the code in future, so that new features/improvements can then be added with less effort.\n\nThat's a hell of a lot of hard work, but it doesn't produce many shiny news to show to users. Only @tarruda's advances in promised milestones, and some other few contributions here and there are of general interest.\n\nThat's why I  think monthly periodicity should be enough by now (even every two months). For advances of particular interest (like recent @tarruda changes on plugin/ui architecture) occurring in the middle of two regular issues, _special_ posts could be issued.\n\nApart from that, I think yours is a great initiative than can definitely help to spread the word and keep people's enthusiasm up.\nThanks!\n",

Maybe I could ask the Neovim followers on Twitter to see what they think as well?\n\nSorry about that. Apparently bimonthly has two different incohesive meanings, haha. I meant twice a month but I agree in that it might be too frequent.\n\nI think every other month might be a bit too infrequent; that might just be me though. Personally I like once a month as @aktau suggested.\n\nAlso, I agree, @elmart, in that the idea of refactoring itself doesn't \"produce many shiny news to show to users.\" However, the way it is refactored and how the code is changing could be pretty exciting to those that have to work with legacy code.\n\nFor \"general interest\" we have the Twitter account for that. I've been trying to keep it as general as possible without putting too much developer talk on it.\n\nRegardless, I really appreciate the feedback.\n",

Obviously nothing that they\nwould need to go out of their way for, but it would be great to show and\nsee you guys are real people doing a great job and giving your time.\n\nThanks.\n\n(Just firing off some thoughts now) Also, you could include mention of some\nof the easier level tasks, especially something like the translation tag, a\ngood newsletter has the ability to reach many people with many talents and\nlanguages, a good set of solid translations is a real boon for an open\nsource project.\n",

Possibly we could make it the first Friday of every month so that this Friday would be the first one?\n\nAlso, I totally agree in that the sites should be merged (yup, they both run Jekyll)... I'm a bit limited on what I can do though as I only have access to the dev-wiki. And there was a strong push at the beginning of neovim.org's creation to keep the site as simple as possible; I didn't want to rock any boats.\n\nI could merge the sites this week as well as write up the first newsletter for this Friday.

I think in the beginning there were some webdevs proclaiming the joys of drupal etc, but at this point we don't have anyone advocating that kind of stuff. \n\n@tarruda @jbranchaud @cweagans dev-wiki is minimal, and neovim.org is a single page. Any comment on merging dev-wiki with neovim.org, with the understanding that neovim.org will continue to be extremely simple (for maintainability as well as user-facing content)?\n",
