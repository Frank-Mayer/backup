In such a case it may be preferred to not have the language server active at all, as their presence is more distracting than helpful.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`vim.lsp.enable()` could be made to respect a new flag in `vim.lsp.Config` that works similarly to `single_file_support` from `nvim-lspconfig`. This flag would tell `vim.lsp.enable()` to only launch the language server when one of the `root_markers` specified in `vim.lsp.Config` is found. ",

I thought the root dir is found by root markers.

It says \"if none of the root markers are found (i.e. there is no root dir), do not launch the server.\"\n\nThe current behavior of `vim.lsp.enable()` is to launch the server with a nil root dir if no root marker is matched, similar to `single_file_support = true`.\n\nPerhaps the new title is more clear?",
