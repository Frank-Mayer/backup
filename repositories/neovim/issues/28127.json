This initially came up in this issue on my project https://github.com/Olical/nfnl/issues/36\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWith the following Lua in your plugin / configuration:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal function callback()\r\n  print(\"EXECUTED\")\r\n  return {foo = true} -- A numerical value also causes the issue, maybe others too but I've only tried table and number so far.\r\nend\r\nvim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({\"Filetype\"}, {callback = callback})\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should see \"EXECUTED\" printed once then never again, even if you repeatedly `:e` different files.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n\"EXECUTED\" should be printed multiple times on every Filetype autocommand execution. You can also see the autocmd under `:autocmd Filetype` initially then see it vanish after the first execution. This does not happen on stable, only on Nightly.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-2755+ge1ff2c51c\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNo, this is only in Neovim nightly.\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux and Windows users have seen this so far.\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nKitty 0.33.0\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nManual .appimage download from GitHub, latest build from today",
