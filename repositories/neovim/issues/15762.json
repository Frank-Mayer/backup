This would slot into `RX` number `0`, so that particular Regex Engine is used by default (typically `Vim` Regex Engine, a.k.a. `RX4`).\r\n - End Users can choose either `RX4` (Vim) as their default Regex Engine, or `RX5` (PCRE) as their default Regex Engine.\r\n - In command mode to switch to another engine (such as switching to PCRE Engine, from Vim Engine), you simply prefix your search/substitution with `RX5`, because PCRE is listed as the `5`th Regex Engine in the list above. This can be done on-the-fly (i.e. the default engine does not change).\r\n - Coincidently, the the Perl/PCRE Engine slots in at \"`RX5`\", providing an easy mnemonic for Perl(5) users, and the Perl6 (a.k.a. Raku) Engine slots in at \"`RX6`\", providing an easy mnemonic for Perl6 users.\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe this proposal adds a \"compatibility layer\" that could make it easier for End Users to adapt a wide-variety of code to the Neovim ecosystem. For example, we might be able to get to the point where End Users could use `RX1` to run `grep` regexes,  `RX2` to run `gawk` regexes, `RX3` to run Emacs regexes, etc. \r\n\r\nThoughts, criticisms? Thank you.\r\n\r\n",

However, I've often wondered if some End Users shied away from adopting Vim as their daily driver because they didn't want to learn the Vim regex engine--for example--heavy users of command-line `grep`, `egrep`, `gawk`, etc.  Regardless, I'll review other syntax proposals along this line (`RX1`, `RX2`, etc.) in \\#\\3208, and/or #14442 (closed).\r\n\r\n> Making it possible is already proposed in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3208 , via transpilation.\r\n\r\nRespectfully submitted:  it's not clear to me that \\#\\3208 is proposing more that enabling End Users to switch to `PCRE` as a default regex engine (an important proposal).  Again, something I'll have to research...but I hoped the \"numbering\" proposal above would open a dialog on this subject. [ It is not clear if I'm able to contribute to the discussion at \\#\\3208 since the Issue is restricted/locked ].\r\n\r\nVim has great support for Perl, and Neovim has done a fantastic job streamlining the language API (for ***multiple different*** languages). I have a personal interest in this topic, since I've posted over 500 Raku one-liners at U&L StackExchange. While I normally test/run those Raku regex answers at the Vim command line, being able to set Raku as a default \"Regex Engine\"  in Neovim would be a huge selling point (for myself, and possibly other Raku users):\r\n\r\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/users/227738/jubilatious1\r\n\r\nRegarding the \"numbering\" proposal: if another Regex Engine comes along that End Users favor, it could be added to the list. So for example:  adding `RX7` to denote Oniguruma (https://oniguruma.org/oniguruma.c/en/),  adding `RX8` to denote `V8` (https://v8.dev/blog/non-backtracking-regexp), etc.\r\n\r\nNone of this has to be built all-at-once, but having a framework in place might attract Pull Requests. \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and attention.",
