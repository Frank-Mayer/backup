For most emoji codepoints that don't explicitly define this, it backs off to \"Neutral\".\r\n\r\nThe possible values for EAW are:\r\n\r\n- Ambiguous (A)\r\n- Fullwidth (F)\r\n- Halfwidth (H)\r\n- Narrow (Na)\r\n- Neutral (N)\r\n- Wide (W)\r\n\r\n~~So it's not \"narrow\" either.~~\r\nupdate:\r\nI think we've fully connected the dots now:\r\nhttp://unicode.org/reports/tr11/#ED7\r\n\r\n`Neutral` is basically `Narrow`.\r\n\r\nSo.... the logic goes:\r\n\r\n1. Fully-qualified emojis in emoji presentation, and those default to emoji presentation, are most probably wide (depending on Emoji style specifications)\r\n2. Fully-qualified emojis in text presentation, and those default to text presentation, are subject to EAW.\r\n3. The default EAW for emoji is `Neutral` which is almost `Narrow`. There are exceptions that some codepoints have overridden the EAW property.\r\n\r\n@bfredl does this make sense for you?",

For example, there is no traditional Japanese way of typesetting Devanagari. Canonical equivalents of narrow and neutral characters may not themselves be narrow or neutral respectively. For example, U+00C5 Å LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE is Neutral, but its decomposition starts with a Narrow character.\r\n\r\n >   Strictly speaking, it makes no sense to talk of narrow and wide for neutral characters, but because for all practical purposes they behave like Na, they are treated as narrow characters (the same as Na) under the recommendations below.\r\n\r\n\r\nÅ (the letter, not ångström) is always single-width in monospace fonts.\r\n\r\n",

Everything is rendered fine at the moment. The contents of `emoji_problem` are below.\r\n  2. `:set cursorline`\r\n  3. Move the cursor up and down to see lines duplicated.\r\n\r\n[Here's a GIF](https://i.imgur.com/d8gHdZ7.gif) demonstrating these three steps and the visual glitch.\r\n\r\nThe file `emoji_problem` has this content:\r\n\r\n    This is the first line ♟️\r\n    Here comes the second line\r\n    Now the third line\r\n\r\nI'm on Arch Linux 5.9.2 running Sway 1.5.1 and Neovim 0.4.4.\r\n\r\nSome observations:\r\n\r\n  * As mentioned before, not all emojis cause this. 🐧 works fine, for example. The [chess pawn emoji](https://emojipedia.org/chess-pawn/) uses codepoint U+FE0F.\r\n  * I could reproduce this without starting Sway: Also in the default Linux terminal (where `echo $TERM` produces `linux`) Neovim doesn't render the lines of `emoji_problem` correctly.\r\n  * Vim 8.2 with `:set cursorline` renders the file correctly.\r\n",

I had a look at the neovim code, but couldn't not figure it out as I'm not that familiar with C (nor neovim codebase). Unfortunately this seems to be low in the list for neovim maintainers (based on the lack of updates).\r\n\r\nI moved emojis to a separate file so I wouldn't need to have that buffer open so often.

I've gone through the same thing, and have seen it happen more than once here in `neovim/issues`. Maybe they're just understaffed or something (don't have enough contributors/moderators/maintainers etc.). Regardless, there's got to be a better, more professional and friendly way to handle such user inquiries than the current strict and defensive/standoffish posture. Just my 2 cents.",
