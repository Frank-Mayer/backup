With this addition it would be possible to list very diagnostic namespace but the cspell one and create separate bindings for jumping to spell diagnostics and the rest of my diagnostics.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMake `vim.diagnostic.GetOpts.namespace` accept an integer or a list of integers. And make sure that functions that use `vim.diagnostic.GetOpts` are updated accordingly.",
