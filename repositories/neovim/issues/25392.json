Example `dd` will delete current line but, will also jump off center. Current suggestions I've seen is to replace `dd` with `ddzz`.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- there are many key bindings to replace -> big configs.\r\n- screen flicker because the initial key binding does one jump and the second `zz` jumps back to the center.\r\n\r\n- everything gets centered including side panels, and \"pop-up windows\" that should not be centered.\r\n\r\n- https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/6005/scroll-without-changing-the-cursor-position\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20431'[Screencast from 2023-09-27\r\n\r\n[18-52-25.webm](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/38912521/b58ec991-6d26-4d82-9af8-d724f0270cf9)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhy is this useful?\r\n- you don't have to look for the cursor\r\n- when searching from the top of the file for a function you'll only see function signature and not the entire body\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell there is no 'native' of making this work and there is [interest](https://vi.stackexchange.com/search?q=center+cursor) in this functionality. I didn't [find any feature request](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aissue+center+cursor+) similar to this one.\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to have a native way of creating buffers with centered mode on so that supporting buffers like debug panels, file explorers and terminals would not get affected.",
