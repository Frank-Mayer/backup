There's a lot of value in being able to uniquely identify windows and buffers for a vim session, so without surrounding context that lets you know you can confidently recycle a buffer doing so would lead to bugs. The signal of whether a buffer is a scratch buffer wouldn't work for this for the reason I gave. Even if you were to do something like enable the reuse of buffer ids of buffers that are wiped out (not just deleted), you still could introduce bugs where plugins store buffer-specific state outside of buffer variables that they would begin applying to the new buffer that claims the id.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've updated the original post that suggested reusing an existing buffer behind the scenes as one of two options, since thinking more about this I'm more worried about that being correct in all uses of this function. Letting a buffer be passed through pushes the responsibility for the correctness to the caller.",
