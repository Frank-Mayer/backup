    "body": "In #189 people are already moaning about the magic \"compile libuv\" scripts we're shipping and proposing solutions which all effectively move the deck chairs around but don't steer the ship.\n\nShould neovim try to provide magic scripts which either fetch dependencies or compile those bundled with the source? Or should we instead provide guidance in the per-platform build instructions on how to fetch and compile (when necessary) the dependencies? (Like we currently do for, e.g., cmake itself.)\n\nMy personal view is that people building neovim from source should have the knowledge to fetch and build the correct libuv from source too and packagers of neovim will just be ignoring the bundled libuv.\n\nFeel free to add comments below. Should @tarruda decide that people can build libuv themselves (or install the appropriate system packages), I'll propose a PR removing all the dependency fetching stuff. Should @tarruda want to keep on with the possibility to compile the world from the neovim top-level make, I would advocate keeping the current subtree approach since I believe it is superior to other solutions.\n",

[NPM](http://npmjs.org/) lets programmers publish modules targeting a specific dependency versions. If two modules have the same dependencies of different versions it simply installs the required dependency version for each module. This scheme works extremely well, node.js programs never have problems with dependencies.\n\nAnd why would the current solution lead to madness? Can you explain or give examples?\n",

It can take time to bring a code base up-to-date--especially if they have breaking or incompatible changes.  Perhaps the project's strongest motivation is not to work with the latest stable of libuv, but something else important to the project--like integrating luajit.\n\nI think it would be ideal if we could keep up-to-date, just not so convinced that it's a \"bug\" if the project decides that other matters are more important than compiling with the latest dependency.  You need some freedom in there to take on upgrading dependencies when the project is ready.\n\nAnd FWIW, I believe we need to give @tarruda some room to fulfill his obligations.  Changing things out from under his feet every step of the way does nothing but impede him.  I'm glad everyone is enthusiastic and wants to help (me included!), but there's something to be said for pinning some things down while things get built up.\n\nAnd to comment more directly on the issue: I think we should document the dependencies, and let developers get them in place.  I don't think NeoVim should be responsible for building them.\n",

After that the top-level `Makefile` might as well go away too.\n\nA starting point for the `INSTALL` file would probably be the build instructions currently in the `README.md` file.\n",

            "body": "> I think that is a big point of contention.\n\nI agree that the opinion is not universally held but the voices shouting the praises of submodules over subtree are undoubtedly fewer than those shouting the reverse. In any case, this is not the right place to argue subtree vs. submodule since it's somewhat orthogonal to the issue of whether third-party should be there at all. Suffice it to say that the third-party directory is not simply untarring the latest libuv release all over the source tree which is clearly a sub-optimal solution.\n\n> I would like to move for a reopening of the discussion, then, as there are plenty of developers who do not feel as though the case has been conclusively made, and this issue has not insignificant consequences for the repository.\n\nI would be happy with that if @tarruda wants to. As it is, I feel I would only be repeating myself if the issue were re-opened and I think I've stated my own position already.\n",
