A similar functionality for neovim is implemented in https://github.com/ncm2/float-preview.nvim, but it would be nice to have this builtin (ideally, toggled by the same option, although it's admittedly not the best nomenclature for neovim).",

The float will either need to be updated whenever the server replies, which can be after any autocmd, or not being displayed until then (Nvim core/runtime could still help with positioning somehow).\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I meant, I may have worded it a bit poorly. It could work something like this: have an autocmd that is fired when the completion float is created and positioned by Neovim, but not displayed (this can probably be `CompleteChanged` even, if the float exists already then). A plugin can then configure the floating window however it sees fit, and unhide it, to avoid flicker. This can be done either in `CompleteChanged`, if the documentation is already available, or it can send a request to the language server and only set the content when it receives a response.\r\n(Just a suggestion; there may be cleaner ways to do this)",
