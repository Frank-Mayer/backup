I've never had this issue with other filetypes.\r\n* I don't have `dbext` installed, apparently.

We're just importing Vim runtime files and whatever changes happen to them.\r\n\r\n>I literally didn't know about any of this\r\n\r\nI believe none of the people maintaining Neovim use SQL on a regular basis, so I'd be surprised if they knew about this plugin too (I certainly didn't until this PR was opened, and I had forgotten about it until you submitted your comment :) ).\r\n\r\n>What would I say? \"I didn't even know I was using your plugin but now the neovim guys told me to have you fix it.\"?\r\n\r\nYep, exactly. You could even be proactive and provide more information about the failure, possibly even send a patch :).",
