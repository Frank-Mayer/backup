I have added screenshots of the output of `:ju` in hopes of making it easier to follow.\r\n\r\n**First case:**\r\n- Open three buffers\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695653294](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/9592ea6b-d445-4e41-81a5-266f9102a2ba)\r\n- `Ctrl+o` to get to the second buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695653276](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/607c9733-69bb-4003-8024-f23b513fc185)\r\n- `:bw` to close the buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695652210](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/67147d3d-9c71-47da-887b-eb36affe7452)\r\n     - Would expect `Ctrl+i` to move to the third buffer again, instead does nothing\r\n- Press `Ctrl+o` to move to the first buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695652371](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/f7b92cfe-4346-4137-b5a9-d20d7b2e8327)\r\n    - For some reason `Makefile` is now in front of `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n    - `:ju` shows we are looking at `Makefile` but the `CHANGELOG.md` buffer is displayed in the window\r\n- Press `Ctrl+i`, index is now on `-invalid-`, still the wrong buffer displayed\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695652436](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/be23d6ed-5fed-45bd-84fd-3ae4785bc697)\r\n- Press `Ctrl+i` again, index is now at `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695653456](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/e371686c-4446-455c-a91d-74202e4f3dbe)\r\n    - Jump list is now inverted from how it was in the beginning\r\n    - From now on you have to press `Ctrl+o` or `Ctrl+i` twice whenever you want to move between these buffers because the first time the `-invalid-` buffer will be selected\r\n\r\n\r\n**Second case:**\r\n- Open three buffers\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695653294](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/9592ea6b-d445-4e41-81a5-266f9102a2ba)\r\n- `Ctrl+o` to get to the second buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695653276](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/607c9733-69bb-4003-8024-f23b513fc185)\r\n- `:bw` to close the buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_16-09-1695652210](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/67147d3d-9c71-47da-887b-eb36affe7452)\r\n- Open a fourth buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_17-09-1695655214](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/26e73acb-6d0b-4ca8-a5ac-ee7174ce8d30)\r\n    - Original jump list entries have switched as in the first case\r\n- Press `Ctrl+o`, goes back to the (previously first) second buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_17-09-1695654629](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/b46443e3-2937-4231-8223-696b461ddfd4)\r\n- Press `Ctrl+o`, index is at `-invalid-` buffer\r\n![2023-09-25_17-09-1695655446](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/d3535c34-4e4e-4071-82dd-7d65fe05e36e)\r\n- Press `Ctrl+o` again, index is at `Makefile`\r\n![2023-09-25_17-09-1695655491](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/0aef409e-8970-4254-8410-2401ab7b8d5a)\r\n- Press `Ctrl+i`\r\n![2023-09-25_17-09-1695655623](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/24727270/e146e8c0-0096-49e6-b18d-6ee6e238e09c)\r\n    - Moves to `README`, completely skipping the `CHANGELOG.md`\r\n    - From now on going from `README` to `Makefile` takes three presses of `Ctrl+o` (because of the invalid buffer) but going from `Makefile` to `README` takes only one press of `Ctrl+i`\r\n\r\nI ran into multiple variations of this behavior during normal usage, some of them even making buffers that are in the jump list completely unreachable by using `Ctrl+i/o` , but I sadly I cannot reproduce them.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect \r\n- navigation to always be symmetric (pressing `Ctrl+o` n times followed by `Ctrl+i` n times always gets me back to where I started and vice versa) \r\n- invalid buffers to either be skipped by `Ctrl+i/o` or removed completely from the jump list, to avoid having to press `Ctrl+i/o` multiple times to get to the next/previous buffer\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.10.0 commit 1635c9e75e21e07c4331cf983e14a11c7e09b119\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nfoot 1.15.3\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nbuild from repo",
