Update `runtime/plugin/osc52.lua` to include a check for `vim.g.osc52 ~= false`. You can then opt out of OSC 52 support by setting `vim.g.osc52 = false` in `init.lua`.\n\nThank you. I think this is a good idea. \n\nHow about aligning it with other builtin plugins and use the `vim.g.loaded_osc52` method? (Just like `let g:loaded_netrw=1 `) Just a random idea ;)",
