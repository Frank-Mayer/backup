In the last few days I started noticing random areas of the editor window being highlighted with a cyan background:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-12-13 16-36-03](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/86065/231e6b68-d17b-4e7a-a762-bf6100288750)\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-12-12 16-32-45](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/86065/3b57e3da-23ae-485c-88e8-667750912cdb)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/86065/87b16317-4fd2-477e-9b2b-f4500236ba4b)\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first I thought that this may be the highlight group `RedrawDebugClear` as it uses `guibg=NvimLightCyan`, but I don't have `redrawdebug` set to anything. The output of `hi` shows no other highlight group with this particular style.\r\n\r\nThe problem doesn't happen often and I'm not sure yet how to reproduce it reliably. Sometimes it happens once or twice within e.g. 15 minutes, other times I can go 2-3 hours without it happening. When it does happen, the only way to seemingly get rid of it is to switch tabs a few times (or possibly another action that essentially redraws the entire screen).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nStill trying to figure this out.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe highlights don't show up\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n8097b4a725\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nUncertain, my config is nvim specific so I can't test it (combined with it only happening every now and then)\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux in a container, Fedora Silverblue host\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nGhostty 0.1.0-main+9b81d57c\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-ghostty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nAUR",

Looking at the SGR stream I think thats supposed to be 242, 242, 242 so the next question is why this is happening... onwards!\r\n> \r\n> ![a](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/86065/75c6a6d8-2e01-47cc-bf38-dc09e36b1dd6)\r\n\r\n@mitchellh:\r\n\r\n> Uhhhh, the program is sending `ESC [ 48:2:0:242:242m` followed by `E` so that color is correct as far as I can tell in the stream. I ran this in iTerm2 and I'm seeing the same result:\r\n> \r\n> ![b](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/86065/44aa0531-0f32-4063-8e50-3b97b57e5873)\r\n\r\n@mitchellh:\r\n\r\n> Noting also that the cyan `E` shows up in Kitty as well. Either your cast doesn't reproduce the issue or this is a downstream bug, but the terminal stream you gave me, that `E` is supposed to be cyan.\r\n\r\nAnd per Discord:\r\n\r\n> Bad news @Yorick Peterse, see latest comment but your \"bug\" reproduces in Kitty and iTerm2. I also decoded the direct SGR stream from your cast and that \"E\" should by cyan.\r\n> This doesn't happen in Gnome terminal because Gnome doesn't appear to support RGB fg colors. So its ignoring the sequence. Asciinema also doesn't appear to support direct RGB setting, that's why it doesn't show up there, either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI didn't experience this issue when I was still running on 0.9.4, so I'm guessing a change introduced to nvim since then may play a role here. I searched through my installed plugins for any references to \"cyan\" or the color code `#00f3f2` (the color shown in this case), but there are no relevant references to the former and no references at all to the latter.",
