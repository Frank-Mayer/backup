    "body": "### Problem\n\nWorking with multiple projects in the same nvim instance is not great. A way that Ive been trying to separate files from different projects is by using tabs and changing the tab working directory to point to the root of each project, but this has the problem that buffers in vim/nvim are not scoped in any way. So things like ctrl-o/ctrl-i, alternate buffer, listing buffers, etc gets polluted from all tabs. There is no way of making a separation.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCreating some sort of group or namespace that buffers can be assigned to, and the ability to ser tabs (or even windows) to have visibility over that group/namespace. \r\n\r\nThis allows to have a default that maintains the current behavior and is non intrusive for users that donâ€™t want to opt in to use this feature.
