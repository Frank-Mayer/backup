man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...\r\n              man -k [apropos options] regexp ...\r\n              man -K [man options] [section] term ...\r\n              man -f [whatis options] page ...\r\n              man -l [man options] file ...\r\n              man -w|-W [man options] page ...\r\n\r\n       DESCRIPTION\r\n              man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The man\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              ual page associated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to  look  only\r\n              in  that  section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see\r\n              DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.\r\n\r\n              The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.\r\n\r\n              1   Executable programs or shell commands\r\n              2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)\r\n              3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)\r\n              4   Special files (usually found in /dev)\r\n              5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd\r\n              6   Games\r\n              7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7), man-pages(7)\r\n              8   System administration commands (usually only for root)\r\n              9   Kernel routines [Non standard]\r\n\r\n              A manual page consists of several sections.\r\n\r\n              Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRON\\xe2\\x80\\x9\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              MEANT, FILES, VERSIONS, STANDARDS, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.\r\n\r\n              The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.\r\n\r\n              bold text          type exactly as shown.\r\n              italic text        replace with appropriate argument.\r\n              [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.\r\n              -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.\r\n              argument ...       argument is repeatable.\r\n              [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.\r\n\r\n              Exact  rendering  may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running\r\n              in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.\r\n\r\n              The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  il\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              lustrate several exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.\r\n\r\n       EXAMPLES\r\n              man ls\r\n                  Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.\r\n\r\n              man man.7\r\n                  Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of \"man 7 man\".)\r\n\r\n              man 'man(7)'\r\n                  Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of \"man 7 man\".  It may be\r\n                  more convenient when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted  to\r\n                  protect them from the shell.)\r\n\r\n              man -a intro\r\n                  Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between suc\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                  cessive displays or skip any of them.\r\n\r\n              man -t bash | lpr -Pps\r\n                  Format  the  manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output\r\n                  for groff is usually PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.\r\n\r\n              man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi\r\n                  This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redi\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                  rection is necessary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a pro\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                  gram such as xdvi or further processed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.\r\n\r\n              man -k printf\r\n                  Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equiv\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                  alent to apropos printf.\r\n\r\n              man -f smail\r\n                  Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.\r\n\r\n       OVERVIEW\r\n              Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made  to  the  search\r\n              path, section order, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.\r\n\r\n              If  set,  various  environment  variables  are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the \"catch-all\"\r\n              variable $MANOPT to any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's  argument  must\r\n              be  escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an ar\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              gument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be spec\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              ified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to \"forget\" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must\r\n              still have been valid.\r\n\r\n              Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may  also\r\n              be preformatted cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.\r\n\r\n              This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you au\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              tomatically, then you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable  to  indicate  your  pre\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              ferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:\r\n\r\n              <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]\r\n\r\n              If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.\r\n\r\n              If  you  find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply\r\n              them, please contact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.\r\n\r\n              Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or  other  topic  that  they\r\n              document, and are not included with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the\r\n              maintainers of the package in question.\r\n\r\n              For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the\r\n              package.\r\n\r\n       DEFAULTS\r\n              The  order  of  sections  to  search  may  be  overridden  by  the  environment  variable  $MANSECT  or  by  the SECTION directive in\r\n              /etc/man_db.conf.  By default it is as follows:\r\n\r\n                     1 1p n l 8 3 3p 0 0p 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7\r\n\r\n              The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default\r\n              (see option -P for details).\r\n\r\n              The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is  in\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              terrogated.   If  -p  was  not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a pre\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n              processor string.  To contain a valid preprocessor string, the first line must resemble\r\n\r\n              '\\\" <string>\r\n\r\n              where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.\r\n\r\n              If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.\r\n\r\n              A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.   Alternatively,\r\n              if  an executable program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the\r\n              manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.\r\n\r\n       OPTIONS\r\n              Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that  require\r\n              an argument, each duplication will override the previous argument value.\r\n\r\n          General options\r\n              -C file, --config-file=file\r\n                     Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.\r\n\r\n              -d, --debug\r\n                     Print debugging information.\r\n\r\n              -D, --default\r\n                     This  option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those\r\n                     options that may have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.\r\n\r\n              --warnings[=warnings]\r\n                     Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of  manual  pages.   warnings  is  a\r\n                     comma-separated  list  of  warning  names; if it is not supplied, the default is \"mac\".  To disable a groff warning, prefix it\r\n                     with \"!\": for example, --warnings=mac,!break enables warnings in the \"mac\" category and disables warnings in the \"break\" cate\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     gory.  See the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWarnings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d node in info groff for a list of available warning names.\r\n\r\n          Main modes of operation\r\n              -f, --whatis\r\n                     Approximately equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See  whatis(1)  for  de\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     tails.\r\n\r\n              -k, --apropos\r\n                     Approximately  equivalent  to  apropos.   Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See\r\n                     apropos(1) for details.\r\n\r\n              -K, --global-apropos\r\n                     Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you  can,  you  should\r\n                     specify  a  section to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default),\r\n                     or regular expressions if the --regex option is used.\r\n\r\n                     Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may  include  false  positives  due  to\r\n                     things  like  comments  in  source files, or false negatives due to things like hyphens being written as \"\\-\" in source files.\r\n                     Searching the rendered text would be much slower.\r\n\r\n              -l, --local-file\r\n                     Activate \"local\" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through  the  system's  manual  collection.\r\n                     Each manual page argument will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-'\r\n                     is listed as one of the arguments, input will be taken from stdin.\r\n\r\n                     If  this option is not used, then man will also fall back to interpreting manual page arguments as local file names if the ar\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     gument contains a \"/\" character, since that is a good indication that the argument refers to a path on the file system.\r\n\r\n              -w, --where, --path, --location\r\n                     Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a\r\n                     option is also used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.\r\n\r\n              -W, --where-cat, --location-cat\r\n                     Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would  be  displayed.   If\r\n                     the -a option is also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.\r\n\r\n                     If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used,\r\n                     then do this for each possible match.\r\n\r\n              -c, --catman\r\n                     This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.\r\n\r\n              -R encoding, --recode=encoding\r\n                     Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already\r\n                     know  the  encoding of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert sev\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     eral manual pages to a single encoding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that  they  were  al\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ready installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.\r\n\r\n                     Consider using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conver\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     sion and so can be much faster.\r\n\r\n          Finding manual pages\r\n              -L locale, --locale=locale\r\n                     man  will  normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environ\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     meant variables, possibly including $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this  option  to\r\n                     supply a locale string directly to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output\r\n                     such as the help message will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.\r\n\r\n              -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]\r\n                     If  this  system has access to other operating systems' manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a\r\n                     manual page from NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.\r\n\r\n                     The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the native  oper\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ating  system's manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM envi\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ronment variable.\r\n\r\n              -M path, --manpath=path\r\n                     Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This  option\r\n                     overrides the $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.\r\n\r\n                     A  path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db\r\n                     manual (under \"The manual page system\").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.\r\n\r\n              -S list, -s list, --sections=list\r\n                     The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in  what\r\n                     order.  This option overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)\r\n\r\n              -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension\r\n                     Some  systems  incorporate  large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual\r\n                     page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl  pages  were\r\n                     usually all assigned to section l.  As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to\r\n                     assign  a specific \"extension\" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Under normal operation, man will display exit(3) in prefer\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ence to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section the page you require resides in, it\r\n                     is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.  Using the above example,\r\n                     supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.\r\n\r\n              -i, --ignore-case\r\n                     Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.\r\n\r\n              -I, --match-case\r\n                     Search for manual pages case-sensitively.\r\n\r\n              --regex\r\n                     Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular  expression,\r\n                     as  with  apropos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a \"best\" page when searching for a regular expression,\r\n                     this option implies -a.\r\n\r\n              --wildcard\r\n                     Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using  shell-style  wild\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     cards,  as  with  apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word bound\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     aries in the description.  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a \"best\" page when searching for a wildcard,  this\r\n                     option implies -a.\r\n\r\n              --names-only\r\n                     If  the  --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no\r\n                     effect.\r\n\r\n              -a, --all\r\n                     By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces  man  to  display\r\n                     all the manual pages with names that match the search criteria.\r\n\r\n              -u, --update\r\n                     This  option  causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and\r\n                     it is normally better to run mandb(8) instead.\r\n\r\n              --no-subpages\r\n                     By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to  a  single  manual\r\n                     page  name containing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of sub\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     commands, allowing them to provide manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to  invoke\r\n                     the subcommands themselves.  For example:\r\n\r\n                       $ man -aw git diff\r\n                       /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz\r\n\r\n                     To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.\r\n\r\n                       $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff\r\n                       /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz\r\n                       /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz\r\n                       /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz\r\n\r\n          Controlling formatted output\r\n              -P pager, --pager=pager\r\n                     Specify  which output pager to use.  By default, man uses less, falling back to cat if less is not found or is not executable.\r\n                     This option overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is  not\r\n                     used in conjunction with -f or -k.\r\n\r\n                     The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or\r\n                     double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the\r\n                     file to display either as an argument or on standard input.\r\n\r\n              -r prompt, --prompt=prompt\r\n                     If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.   The  default\r\n                     prompt looks like\r\n\r\n                      Manual page name(sec) line x\r\n\r\n                     where  name  denotes  the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is\r\n                     achieved by using the $LESS environment variable.\r\n\r\n                     Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to  the\r\n                     name  of the current manual page and its section name surrounded by \"(\" and \")\".  The string used to produce the default could\r\n                     be expressed as\r\n\r\n                     \\ Manual\\ page\\ \\$MAN_PN\\ ?ltline\\ %lt?L/%L.:\r\n                     byte\\ %bB?s/%s..?\\ (END):?pB\\ %pB\\\\%..\r\n                     (press h for help or q to quit)\r\n\r\n                     It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt\r\n                     string is first evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must  be  escaped  by  a\r\n                     preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default\r\n                     man sets the -ix8 options.\r\n\r\n                     The  $MANLESS  environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the com\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     mand line.\r\n\r\n              -7, --ascii\r\n                     When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not  display  correctly\r\n                     when  using  the  latin1(7)  device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in\r\n                     ascii with the latin1 device.  It will not translate any latin1 text.  The following table shows the  translations  performed:\r\n                     some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.\r\n\r\n                     Description           Octal   latin1   ascii\r\n                     \\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\\xe2\\x94\\x80\r\n                     continuation hyphen    255      \\xe2\\x80\\x90        -\r\n                     bullet (middle dot)    267      \\xe2\\x80\\xa2        o\r\n                     acute accent           264      \\xc2\\xb4        '\r\n                     multiplication sign    327      \\xc3\\x97        x\r\n\r\n                     If  the  latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.\r\n                     If the latin1 and ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page us\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ing the latin1 device description.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual  pages  with  this\r\n                     option.\r\n\r\n                     This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.\r\n\r\n              -E encoding, --encoding=encoding\r\n                     Generate  output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device\r\n                     such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.\r\n\r\n              --no-hyphenation, --nh\r\n                     Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary\r\n                     to do so to lay out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only\r\n                     be hyphenated if they already contain hyphens.\r\n\r\n                     If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate  point,  do  not\r\n                     use this option, but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put \"\\%\" inside a word to indicate that it\r\n                     may be hyphenated at that point, or put \"\\%\" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.\r\n\r\n              --no-justification, --nj\r\n                     Normally,  nroff  will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified\r\n                     only to the left margin, sometimes called \"ragged-right\" text.\r\n\r\n                     If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this  option,\r\n                     but  consult  the  nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the \".na\", \".nf\", \".fi\", and \".ad\" requests to tem\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     porarily disable adjusting and filling.\r\n\r\n              -p string, --preprocessor=string\r\n                     Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of  pre\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     processors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind\r\n                     (v),  refer  (r).   This  option overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first pre\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     processor.\r\n\r\n              -t, --troff\r\n                     Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.\r\n\r\n              -T[device], --troff-device[=device]\r\n                     This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.   It  im\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     plies -t.  Examples (as of groff 1.23.0) include dvi, latin1, pdf, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.\r\n\r\n              -H[browser], --html[=browser]\r\n                     This  option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is\r\n                     determined by the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time de\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     fault if that is unset (usually lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.\r\n\r\n              -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]\r\n                     This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be\r\n                     75,  75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75,\r\n                     X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respectively.\r\n\r\n              -Z, --ditroff\r\n                     groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen  device.   If  groff\r\n                     -mandoc is groff, this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.\r\n\r\n          Getting help\r\n              -?, --help\r\n                     Print a help message and exit.\r\n\r\n              --usage\r\n                     Print a short usage message and exit.\r\n\r\n              -V, --version\r\n                     Display version information.\r\n\r\n       EXIT STATUS\r\n              0      Successful program execution.\r\n\r\n              1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.\r\n\r\n              2      Operational error.\r\n\r\n              3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.\r\n\r\n              16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.\r\n\r\n       ENVIRONMENT\r\n              MANPATH\r\n                     If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.\r\n\r\n                     See the SEARCH PATH section of manpath(5) for the default behaviour and details of how this environment variable is handled.\r\n\r\n              MANROFFOPT\r\n                     Every  time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command\r\n                     line.\r\n\r\n                     For example, MANROFFOPT=-P-i tells the formatter to use italic text (which is only supported by some  terminals)  rather  than\r\n                     underlined text.\r\n\r\n              MANROFFSEQ\r\n                     If  $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default\r\n                     preprocessor list is system dependent.\r\n\r\n              MANSECT\r\n                     If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used  to  determine  which  manual  sections  to\r\n                     search and in what order.  The default is \"1 1p n l 8 3 3p 0 0p 2 3type 5 4 9 6 7\", unless overridden by the SECTION directive\r\n                     in /etc/man_db.conf.\r\n\r\n              MANPAGER, PAGER\r\n                     If  $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display\r\n                     the manual page.  By default, less is used, falling back to cat if less is not found or is not executable.\r\n\r\n                     The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes,  or\r\n                     double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the\r\n                     file to display either as an argument or on standard input.\r\n\r\n              MANLESS\r\n                     If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the\r\n                     -r  option  (so  any  occurrences  of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the\r\n                     prompt string unconditionally to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmy prompt string\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, set $MANLESS to \\xe2\\x80\\x98-Psmy prompt string\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  Using  the  -r  option  overrides\r\n                     this environment variable.\r\n\r\n              BROWSER\r\n                     If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web\r\n                     browser for man --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %%  is  replaced\r\n                     by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by a colon (:).\r\n\r\n              SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.\r\n\r\n              MANOPT If  $MANOPT  is  set,  it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the\r\n                     other man specific environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being  included\r\n                     in  $MANOPT it is expected that they will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's\r\n                     argument must be escaped.\r\n\r\n              MANWIDTH\r\n                     If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set,  man\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ual  pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2)\r\n                     if available, or falling back to 80 characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the  default  for\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     matting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.\r\n\r\n              MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING\r\n                     Normally,  when  output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded\r\n                     to make it easier to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any  non-empty  value,\r\n                     these  formatting  characters  are retained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting charac\\xe2\\x80\\x90\r\n                     ters.\r\n\r\n              MAN_KEEP_STDERR\r\n                     Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to  produce\r\n                     formatted  versions  of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often\r\n                     produce relatively minor error messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally\r\n                     confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR  is\r\n                     set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.\r\n\r\n              MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP\r\n                     On  Linux,  man  normally confines subprocesses that handle untrusted data using a seccomp(2) sandbox.  This makes it safer to\r\n                     run complex parsing code over arbitrary manual pages.  If this goes wrong for some reason unrelated to the content of the page\r\n                     being displayed, you can set $MAN_DISABLE_SECCOMP to any non-empty value to disable the sandbox.\r\n\r\n              PIPELINE_DEBUG\r\n                     If the $PIPELINE_DEBUG environment variable is set to \"1\", then man will print debugging messages to standard error describing\r\n                     each subprocess it runs.\r\n\r\n              LANG, LC_MESSAGES\r\n                     Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current  message\r\n                     locale.  man will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.\r\n\r\n       FILES\r\n              /etc/man_db.conf\r\n                     man-db configuration file.\r\n\r\n              /usr/share/man\r\n                     A global manual page hierarchy.\r\n\r\n       STANDARDS\r\n              POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, POSIX.1-2017.\r\n\r\n       SEE ALSO\r\n              apropos(1), groff(1), less(1), manpath(1), nroff(1), troff(1), whatis(1), zsoelim(1), manpath(5), man(7), catman(8), mandb(8)\r\n\r\n              Documentation for some packages may be available in other formats, such as info(1) or HTML.\r\n\r\n       HISTORY\r\n              1990, 1991 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Originally written by John W.

Here's my configs:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> # ~/.config/plasma-localerc\r\n> [Formats]\r\n> LANG=en_US.UTF-8\r\n> LC_MEASUREMENT=pl_PL.UTF-8\r\n> LC_MONETARY=pl_PL.UTF-8\r\n> LC_PAPER=pl_PL.UTF-8\r\n> LC_TELEPHONE=pl_PL.UTF-8\r\n> LC_TIME=pl_PL.UTF-8\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> # /etc/locale.conf\r\n> LANG=en_US.UTF-8\r\n> LANGUAGE=en_US.UTF-8\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> # /etc/locale.gen\r\n> en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8  \r\n> pl_PL.UTF-8 UTF-8\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> I've run `sudo locale-gen` and restarted but the issue still persists. Maybe someone could tell me what I'm doing wrong. I've read the entire [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale) on Arch Wiki with no help.\r\n\r\nI took some inspiration from this and added `LANGUAGE` to `plasma-localerc`, rebooted. Everything works now.... Now wondering how to file this with bugs.kde....\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nFor added info for anyone else, locale must be generated for `LANG` and `LANGUAGE` envvars in `plasma-localerc` whereas translation locales are not required to be generated.",
