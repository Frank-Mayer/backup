I tend to think that global enable() should act like a gate: \r\n\r\n- if globally enabled, then defer to the buffer-local flag\r\n- if globally disabled, don't check the buffer-local flag\r\n\r\nIOW: buffer-local \"enable\" flag has precedence unless the feature is globally disabled.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNeed a clear pattern for all such modules to follow. This may have implications for other kinds of \"config\" besides mere \"enablement\".\r\n\r\nThe behavior of vim *options* (`:help global-local`, ignoring other kinds of option scopes) would imply that the global setting is only the \"default\", and any buffer-local setting should always override the global default.",

This means that after it is equalized, its state will change as the global state changes.\r\n\r\nAs I said in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28543#discussion_r1587049857:\r\n\r\n>The logic behind this design is that if it can be globally `enable` or locally `enable`, when the user selects local `enable`, we think the user's purpose is to distinguish the local state from the global state. I think this design is good for interaction,\r\n\r\nIt is the best choice that can be made under the following constraints:\r\n\r\n>...there is no way to remove \"local variables\" by using `enable`. Once the user manages a buffer's `bufstate`, it means that they must manage it all the time, there's no way to make them follow the `globalstate`.\r\n\r\nAnd if we add more filters, like what https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28521 tries to do, it should be hard to manage by global or buffer variables.",

If we adopt a model where the global state acts as a gate and then defer to local states, the way of modeling \"I want to have this feature disabled but I want to enable it for a single buffer\" becomes very difficult to represent. If the user has an option disabled globally and they do something to toggle locally then nothing would happen. Then if they enable it globally it could end up applying to all open buffers even if the user doesn't mean to do that.\r\n\r\nI tend to like that the current design logic represents, \"we do the most specific thing that the user has asked for so far\"",
