I'm happy to move this issue elsewhere if this is not the right place for it. \r\n\r\nWhen pasting (e.g. through `CTRL+SHIT+V` or middle-click) under WSL the text gets fragmented into irregular chunks. This results in multiple `vim.paste()` calls, even for a single paste. The issue persists across multiple terminal emulators (Windows Terminal, Alacritty, Wezterm). The fragmentation is not consistent and varies between pastes. No issues on Windows 11 (non-WSL). Text is fragmented on Ubuntu WSL and Arch WSL.\r\n\r\nThe output of `:messages` after pasting is: \r\n\r\n```\r\nNeovim is a\r\nproject\r\nthat seek\r\ns to ag\r\ngressive\r\nly refac\r\ntor Vim\r\n```\r\n\r\nFragmentation is not consistent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNeov \r\nim is a \r\nproject \r\nthat see \r\nks to aggresive \r\nly refac\r\ntor Vim\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUnder WSL, run `nvim -u minimal_init.lua` and copy a line, e.g.: \r\n\r\n```\r\nNeovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen paste (e.g. through `CTRL+SHIFT+V` or middle-click) and observe the output of `:messages`.\r\n\r\n**minimal_init.lua** \r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.paste = (function(overridden)\r\n\treturn function(lines, phase)\r\n\t\tfor _, line in ipairs(lines) do\r\n\t\t\tprint(line)\r\n\t\tend\r\n\t\toverridden(lines, phase)\r\n\tend\r\nend)(vim.paste)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA single paste should result in only one `vim.paste()` call. The output of `:messages` should be: \r\n\r\n```\r\nNeovim is a project that seeks to aggressively refactor Vim\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM 0.9.4 (also tested on nightly)\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNot tested\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nWindows 11\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWindow Terminal\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nAUR ",

If the paste behaviour is not intended to be consistent across different environments, then closing the issue is fine I guess. \n\nHowever, what is the reason for fragmentation?
