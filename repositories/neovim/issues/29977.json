    "body": "### Problem\n\n**Summary**\r\nThe \"edit-files-within-a-zip-archive-without-extracting-first\" feature of Neovim doesn't work for a member named `[Content_Types].xml`, possibly because of the square brackets in the name.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nNeovim allows members of (\"files\" within) a Zip archive to be opened with a `netrw` type of interface. `:e file.zip` displays a list of the archive members, moving the cursor over one and pressing Enter opens it.\r\n\r\nThe `.docx`, `.pptx`, and `.xlsx` file formats are all Zip archives. A required member for these formats is `[Content_Types].xml` which maps other members to their MIME-type.\r\n\r\nThis behavior works fine on v0.9.1. I noticed the problem on 0.11.0-dev-482 and it's still there on 0.11.0-dev-573. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- grab any DOCX, PPTX, or XLSX file, this link has one but any will do: https://dynamiclearningmaps.org/sites/default/files/documents/ELA_EEs/math_EE_overviewby_grade_EXTERNAL_July_2014.xlsx\r\n- `:e math_EE_overviewby_grade_EXTERNAL_July_2014.xlsx`\r\n- Move cursor onto `[Content_Types].xml` and press Enter\r\n- Buffer is empty, but `unzip -l math_...xlsx` reports size `2793` (and this member is never empty for these file types).\r\n- Opening any other member in the archive produces content.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nShould show content, probably two lines, the first an XML declaration like `<?xml version=\"1.0\"...>` and then all the XML content on a very long second line.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev-573+g58406ab9f-Homebrew\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't have that installed\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20240203-110809-5046fc22, but same on iTerm2 v3.5.3\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbrew install neovim --HEAD",
