If all UI clients have detached, don't trigger `VimResume` until a UI client attaches, otherwise trigger `VimResume`. This makes behavior more backward-compatible, but less consistent as it depends on timing.\r\n",

I'm not doing anything crazy in my personal setup (I don't think anyway, although I am using a recent `HEAD` install/build and this issue doesn't seem to exist on `v0.8.3`), just running nvim directly in my terminal and I happen to suspend and resume nvim often (because it feels easier and quicker to do `CTRL-Z -> cmd -> fg` than having to switch windows/tabs, enter terminal mode, do a shell command, then exit terminal mode with 2 different `CTRL-*` keystrokes, and finally switch back to the previous window/tab).\r\n\r\nI have a plugin currently that relies on `VimResume`, and relies on it firing upon resume and not suspend (mainly just in order to run `:checktime` and trigger `'autoread'` upon resume/re-entry so that I don't have to worry about having/editing outdated buffers - after a git checkout for example). What is meant by `external TUI`? Will `VimResume` ever be fixed, or restored to its previous behavior? Thanks 👍",

It's strange. Also these issues are often prioritized in search engine results when folks are seeking help and serve as a central location for users to obtain further information or temporary workarounds.\r\n\r\nI received 0 help on this issue after my comment left months ago, so I will offer you my own 2 cents based on my own trial and error, because it does not appear that this will be fixed anytime soon. You can try using a `UIEnter` autocmd in place of `VimResume` for the time being, since this does seem to fire on resume. Apparently the current implementation disconnects (detaches) from the default TUI on suspend and then reconnects on resume IIRC (or something along those lines)...although I am not sure if using `UIEnter` like this will be as dependable or will work as well as VimResume (used to), plus it might not work as expected if you have multiple UI's or are using a gui nvim, etc. There's also the function `nvim_list_uis()` which may be of use to you as well (maybe to check which UI's are attached while in the autocmd, if needed).\r\n\r\nI've tried a couple of other things, like trying to setup a signal handler via autocmds or libuv, but had no success. So this appears to be the only simple/straightforward workaround AFAIK.",
