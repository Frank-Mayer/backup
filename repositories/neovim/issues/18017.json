Table of content seems to only have 2 levels, far from enough for some topics which have many 'if' branches\r\n4. For most (neovim) users, I guess, vi default values are useless and annoying. `{not in Vi}` clutters up the document.\r\nref: https://groups.google.com/g/vim_dev/c/v01mzeb2kz4 \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53520949/162170026-a8666645-4f86-499c-b6ee-1141847ba0ce.png)\r\n  ( So I ask here, instead of the original vim repo ) \r\n\r\nMy twick (including ftplugin/help.vim and syntax/help.vim):   https://github.com/sisrfeng/modern_vim_doc\r\n (Sorry for too busy to translate some comments to English)",
