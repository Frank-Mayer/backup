Previously `<C-u>` jumped/scrolled half of the screen no matter is line folded or not (so folds treated like 1 line), but currently `<C-u>` is stopped at each closed fold. `<C-d>` behave like it was previously (if we omit the situation about scrolling below the end of file).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nYou can test it with file like https://github.com/monkoose/neocodeium/blob/main/lua/neocodeium/server.lua or create some file with some folds one after another\r\n- nvim --clean server.lua\r\n- yank/paste few times folds in this file for greater visibility of the issue\r\n- Close all folds\r\n- From start of the file use `<C-d>` and then use `<C-u>` few times.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`<C-u>` should jump/scroll half of the window height even when closed folds are present.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2823+g7560aee595\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, vim 9.1.145 (some version before that notorious PR)\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nst\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nst-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nAUR",
