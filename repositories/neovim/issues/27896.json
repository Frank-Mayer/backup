    "body": "### Problem\n\nI am writing a plugin for neovim that aims to provide training for new users. A task I would like to implement eventually is the creation of marks. My code uses autocommands to act after the user has interacted with neovim. As far as I can tell, there is no autocommand-event that fires after a mark has been created. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe solution seems straightforward from the outside: Add a autocommand-event that is triggered after mark creation. Since I am not familiar with the codebase, I have trouble deciding how much effort this actually is. If there is some positive feedback, I might attempt a pr for this use case myself. \r\n",
