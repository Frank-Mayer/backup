The warning is written when an LSP client that does not support code lenses is attached to a different buffer at the time the code lens executes.\r\n\r\nThe source appears to be a call to `vim.lsp.codelens.refresh` out of the [`execute_lens` handler](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/27fb62988e922c2739035f477f93cc052a4fee1e/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/codelens.lua#L53). Prior to 0.10, this would only refresh lenses for the current buffer but now it attempts to refresh lenses for all buffers.\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\n1. Open a file and attach an LSP that does not support code lenses (e.g. dockerls)\r\n2. Open a different file in another buffer and attach an LSP that does support code lenses\r\n3. Execute a code lens in the second buffer\r\n4. Observe that a warning is written\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRunning a code lens should not result in warnings associated with unrelated clients that are not attached to the current buffer.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0\n\n### Language server name/version\n\ngopls v0.15.3 and dockerls v0.12.0\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS Sonoma and Ubuntu Linux 22.04\n\n### Log file\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/sykesm/55a67323b8af9bea59d61ee7d9a0d7fe",
