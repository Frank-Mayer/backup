I used to have foldtext\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nfunction FoldText()\r\n  local text = vim.treesitter.foldtext() --[[ @as string[] ]]\r\n  local n_lines = vim.v.foldend - vim.v.foldstart\r\n  table.insert(text, { ' Û∞ÅÇ ' .. n_lines, { 'Folded' } })\r\n  return text\r\nend\r\n\r\nvim.opt.foldmethod = 'expr'\r\nvim.opt.foldexpr = 'v:lua.vim.treesitter.foldexpr()'\r\nvim.opt.foldtext = 'v:lua.FoldText()'\r\n```\r\n \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWould it still be possible to expose the default implementation of `foldtext()` as a Lua function?",
