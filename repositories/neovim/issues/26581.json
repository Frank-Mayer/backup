This occurs both in nvim running as an appimage and in vim installed from the systems package manager. I also tested on a personal laptop running a completely different setup and found the same issue. A reddit comment mentioned a plugin called matchit that should fix the issue, but also claimed it was already integrated into nvim (I double checked and it shows in the plugins directory).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. run nvim with no config\r\n2. :syntax on\r\n3. input the following code: \r\n```c\r\nint\r\nmain()\r\n{\r\n        // test { test\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. put cursor on the final curly brace and press '%'\r\n5. cursor will jump to the curly brace in comments\n\n### Expected behavior\n\ncursor should jump to the opening curly brace of main\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.9.1 (also tested on v0.9.4)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nThis behavior is in both vim and neovim\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nCentOS Linux 7\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ntmux\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage",
