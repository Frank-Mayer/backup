    "body": "### Problem\n\nNetrw has a lot of problems:\n- It is monolithic and tries to do too many things\n- Is really difficult to modify / extend by plugins\n- It is hard to fix and triage bugs since it is a thousand more lines of plugin written in legacy vimscript with like 1 space indentation\n- Has some really poor UX decisions (multifile operations, alternate file is buggy, ...)\n\nHaving said that, Netrw is something that a lot of users, including myself, and it is probably a bad idea to replace it with an entirely different plugin.\n\n### My solution\n\nI was thinking for a while to write a Netrw compatible file explorer written in lua that address the issues mentioned above. I've worked on some patches wile developing for vim and I've studied the code a lot so I think I can do this.\n\nI wanna to ask if is it something that the maintainers would be interested in. If so, I would love to working in on myself. Firstly I would probably do a standalone plugin and that as it matures maybe merge it into neovim.",
