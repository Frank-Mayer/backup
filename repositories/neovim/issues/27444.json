Problem/Expected behavior was written too short and not detailed enough; it'd be great if they could be self-contained.\r\n\r\nThe lua annotation of `vim.fn.bufnr()` takes `any?` type and returns `integer`, and I don't see anything wrong with it. What you said doesn't align with the current Lua annotations.\r\n\r\nSame for `vim.fn.bufname()`. It returns `string` and takes `any?` type as the first parameter, so it's also not wrong, although they could be more specific; i.e. to narrow down it to `(string|integer)?` instead of `any?`.",
