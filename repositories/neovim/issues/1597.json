All of them are from neovim forked dependencies. Therefore, I have following questions:\n- Is it necessary to have neovim forking these repo as it will add workload to sync them with upstream changes?\n- The deps' urls are not versionized. So any changes in that branch will break the checksum, hence break the building.\n\n/cc @tarruda  \n",

It looks like Paul Evans fixed a bug for us, but it's not released as a tarball anywhere.  I'm not sure how the mirroring is set up, but it's feasible that we only need to update when we trip across a bug for now and when a real release is available that works we can drop our mirror.\n\n> The deps' urls are not versionized. So any changes in that branch will break the checksum, hence break the building.\n\nI saw that too.  It's not that they aren't versioned at all (it's pulling from a tag), but if the thought was that we're going to update the tag, then we'd definitely break people.  Perhaps a tag of `neovim-<date>` or something similar would be better?\n",
