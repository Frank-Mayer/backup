Commands that change execution flow in cycles:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   execute 'break'\r\n   command UserBreak continue\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   I do not know why these may be used.\r\n2. Return statements. Examples:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   execute 'return' expr\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   may be used as a replacement for `return eval(expr)`,\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   command -nargs=1 LoggedReturn :let __r=<args> | call LogReturnValue(expand('<sfile>'), __r) | return __r\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   may be used for logging returns. One may also use this variant to implement one kind of function decorators: those that modify return value after function was run (note: commands have full access to function scope).\r\n3. (Already discussed?) partial function definition:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   execute 'function Abc()'\r\n       \" Function body\r\n   endfunction\r\n   ```\r\n   \r\n   . This may be used for things like decorating functions, but it is very hard to implement, especially given that `:execute` may actually be `:UserCommand`.\r\n4. (Already discussed AFAIR) Incomplete block entry commands:\r\n   \r\n   ```\r\n   execute 'if' expr\r\n   execute 'while' expr\r\n   execute 'for x in' expr\r\n   ```\r\n5. (Already discussed, just adding here for completeness) Incomplete `:append`-like commands.\r\n\r\nDiscussed 3, 4 and 5 were discussed because they are not supported by parser and thus are very hard to implement. New 1 and 2 are much easier to implement, but I think that code with 1. smells and 2. is hacky enough I never saw it in the wild (untested BTW) and thus is not worth supporting. I probably have not seen 2. due to `&verbose` option. Or because those who know that this is possible (there should not be too much people knowing about this hack) consider this solution too hacky. Due to the variety of possible uses of 2. I am asking here whether anybody have seen it actually used.\r\n\r\n",

Adding a hack to treat specifically this sequence specially (meaning that e.g. wrapping everything in `:execute` on per-command basis or adding `:if` to include other command in sequence depending on condition will disable this hack).\n2. Deferring parsing of the command that is to be executed up until command is actually launched.\n\nThere is an interesting fact that errors like “Missing endif” are not reported from autocommands. This thing is definitely not to be supported, even if any of the above solutions are implemented.\n",
