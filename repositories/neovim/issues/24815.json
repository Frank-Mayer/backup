    "body": "### Problem\n\nNote: I am building neovim from the 0.9.1 tag on a Debian-based x86-64 system.\r\n\r\n1.) Wrong install directory\r\n\r\nWhen I follow the instructions to build and install neovim on my Debian-based machine at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim#quick-start, I end up with neovim installed to `/usr/bin/nvim`, `/usr/share/nvim/runtime/`, `/usr/share/nvim/man1/nvim.1`, `/usr/share/locale/`  `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/128x128`. However, because the default install location is `/usr/local`, nvim will resort to\r\n\r\n`fall-back for $VIM: \"/usr/local/share/nvim\"`\r\n\r\nand fail to find its support files.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix this, `-D CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local` must be passed to `cpack` when generating the `.deb` archive.\r\n\r\nThe install scripts should derive this and `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` from the same source of truth.\r\n\r\n2.) Wrong permissions\r\n\r\nThe build scripts generate files into `./build` with permissions 750. When `dpkg` moves them to `/usr/` or `/usr/local/` (as the case may be), it retains those permissions but sets the owner and group to root. As a result, when invoked as a non-superuser, neovim cannot read its own support files. These files should be generated with permissions 755 instead.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this is set up correctly in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/v0.9.1/cmake/InstallHelpers.cmake, so I wonder if I'm doing something wrong.\r\n\r\n3.) Wrong runtime path\r\n\r\nAfter passing `-D CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local` and running `chmod -R o+rx` on all the support directories, I have a working `nvim` in `/usr/local/bin/nvim`, but it is still searching for support files in `/usr/local/share/nvim`, not `/usr/local/share/nvim/runtime`. As a result, I see\r\n\r\n`E484: Can't open file /usr/local/share/nvim/syntax/syntax.vim`\r\n\r\nbecause the file is actually at `/usr/local/share/nvim/runtime/syntax/syntax.vim`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nsee above\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nsee above\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.29.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo / dpkg",
