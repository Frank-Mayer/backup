Freaked me out at first, because I was worried my storage might have become damaged.\r\n\r\nUpon exiting my terminal app and re-entering, there were no more misrepresented characters. I have since downloaded and am using version 0.9.2 and no issues thus far.\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nN/A\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI desire the same thing you all do :  a safe and reliable editor for my work. I like the goal of NVIM and where it is heading. I recently removed classic vim v9, in favor of Neo.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n10\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nchrome / debian\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nchrome terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage",
