This shouldn't be because of the ERROR, since we can usually capture inside an ERROR like here:\r\n<img width=\"1694\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-01 at 16 24 11\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7075380/9d12bc91-5f49-4d5d-aaf5-64b2437f71c9\">\r\n\r\nI wanted to test something similar for 0.9.4 and show that we can capture it there, but I don't think there is something like the query editor in 0.9.4? Is there some way I could better test this?\r\n\r\nAlso, is this considered a neovim bug or a parser bug? (Should I report this somewhere else?)\r\n\r\nNote: The `c` parser parses macros using language injections, if that helps clarify what might be causing this issue. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n`nvim test.c`\r\nWrite: `#define TEST (-1)`\r\n`:w<CR>`\r\n`:InspectTree<CR>`\r\n`o`\r\nWrite `(parenthesized_expression) @test` in the query editor (or `(number_literal) @test`) and place the cursor on `@test` in normal mode.\r\n\r\nNote that we can't capture any of the above.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLike my last picture above, we should capture the corresponding queries. \r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.10.0-dev-2005+gf69658bc3-Homebrew\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.2.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nhomebrew",

From what I can tell it was a problem with my queries, but what confused me was that the `c` parser and `rust` parser work differently, so I have to write language specific code that I didn't think would be necessary. (Rust also uses language injections for macros, but they don't work the exact same way.)",
