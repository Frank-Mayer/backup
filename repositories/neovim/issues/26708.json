    "body": "### Problem\n\nCurrently, neovim doesn't have a UI protocol for graphics.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA new UI protocol for graphics would be added.\r\nThere would be three possible graphical elements, buffer-local, window-local, and global:\r\n* The buffer-local one would use extmark for the position of the graphical element. If the graphic is cut off by a window boundary, then only the part in the buffer should be seen.\r\n* The window-local one would use window positioning, including positioning from the bottom/right with negative numbers so that bottom/right graphical elements wouldn't need to be updated every time the window size changes.\r\n* The global one would work similarly to the window-local one, but use global positioning instead.\r\n\r\nAfter implementing the protocol, I suggest implementing a fallback system for the neovim tui: by default, a program that converts graphics to ASCII art would be used. A new option should also be added, that can specify an external program to use to convert graphics to ASCII art. There should also be an option to disable this feature. I also propose that a graphical element could set the ASCII art fallback, instead of relying on a program.\r\n\r\nLater on, we could extend the neovim-tui UI handler to work with terminals that implement some sort of graphical rendering.\r\nRelated issues: #4500, #12991",
