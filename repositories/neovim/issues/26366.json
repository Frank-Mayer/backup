The `~` is used to show the non-existence of the line in the actual buffer, but this isn't a feature for the top of a file.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nGo to the first line of a document with `gg`.  Redraw line at centre of window using `zz`.  This will move the first line to the centre of the window, with `~` as padding before the first line.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be useful if you have a tall screen, and you wish to edit the top of a file in the centre of your window.  It would also make the beginning and the end of a document consistent in behaviour.",
