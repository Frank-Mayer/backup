    "body": "This is a tracking/roadmap issue for follow-up work after #26334. It is meant more about discussing *what* should be done with more details inside dedicated issues (if necessary).\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n- [x] Tweak default highlight groups based on the feedback. I am not sure it is a good idea to deviate too much from \"be minimal and green-blue\" requirement, but at least concious consideration should be done here. Some early feedback:\r\n    <details><summary>Issues addressed in #26540</summary>\r\n\r\n    - Consider changing base lightness values of grey colors to increase contrast. Maybe something like `{ 4, 8, 16, 32 }` (*very* high contrast) or `{ 5, 10, 20, 30 }` (slightly less increase in contrast for `Normal` but significantly more for `Comment`) can work.\r\n    \r\n        It also seems important to not lean too much into \"high contrast\" territory, as it is also not an average good UI. Just enough to make it accessible (even more than now) should be good.\r\n\r\n    - Use 0-15 colors for `cterm` attributes after #26407 is merged. This allows both to have good experience with `nvim --clean` for new users and respect terminal colors for anyone who wants/needs it. See #26389.\r\n \r\n    - Right now `Special` highlight group is the same as Normal. It is a relatively highly linked highlight group, but so is `Identifier`. As there are only cyan and blue available (green is for strings) I decided to leave `Special` unhighlighted. It can be made magenta or bold blue/cyan; both don't look quite minimal to me, though.\r\n    \r\n        Or just cyan as it might be better to be highlighted as *something* than not be highlighted at all (as per [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26369#issuecomment-1837516465)).\r\n\r\n    - Use any attribute only when they are intended to be different. Example: revert `DiagnosticFloating*` back to link to `Diagnostic*`. Also maybe all \"base\" syntax groups (`Constant`, `Statement`, `PreProc`, `Type`) and similar that are intended to \"not be extra highlighted\".\r\n\r\n    - Make `EndOfBuffer` different from `Whitespace` as per [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/21694#issuecomment-1575756133).\r\n    - Make `QuickFixLine` blue or cyan (as per [this comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/26369#issuecomment-1837497703)).\r\n    - Maybe make `Search`, `CurSearch`, and `IncSearch` be actually different. Ideas: make `CurSearch` have bold foreground; make `CurSearch` be the `Search` from other dark/light variant (so for dark it would have `NvimLightYellow` as background and `NvimDarkGrey1` as foreground).\r\n\r\n    - Consider removing [these lines](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/66f1563c7a48d76f99c89e32de030e57af2abfb4/runtime/colors/default.vim#L7-L11) from 'runtime/colors/default.vim' as they don't do in Neovim what they claim to do. They reset `'bg'` back to default which is 'dark'. This breaks if there is a `set bg=light` followed by `:colorscheme default`.\r\n\r\n    - Consider reverting `WinSeparator` to depend on `VertSplit`. It might be better for Vim's color scheme compatibility. But since the latter was deprecated in 0.8.0, it seems to be a good opportunity to pull the plug now.\r\n\r\n    - Update 'runtime/colors/vim.vim' for `Visual` to have `cterm` values. See #26468.\r\n    </details>\r\n\r\n    - Address statusline usability. See #26921.\r\n    - Address `IncSearch` behavior. See #26922.\r\n\r\n    - <s> Don't create cleared highlight groups (as now are \"core\" syntax groups, `Statement`, `@variable`, etc.). This doesn't quite work with `@`-highlight groups due to their fallback. Example: cleared groups fall back to `@text.literal.block.markdown` which falls back to `@text.literal` which is linked to `Comment`.\r\n        Solution: define those explicitly to have `Normal` foreground and no background. </s>\r\n        Addressed in #27188.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Add proper terminal colors for built-in terminal. Right now they are inherited from terminal emulator (except background and foreground), but it doesn't seem right and can lead to not really usable built-in terminal.\r\n    Discussed in #26857.\r\n- [x] Consider tweaking built-in tree-sitter and LSP highlight groups. Both [defaults](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0d885247b03439ee3aff4c0b9ec095a29bb21759/src/nvim/highlight_group.c#L218-L289) (tried to not alter them at all) and maybe for filetypes with built-in tree-sitter parsers (Lua, C, vimdoc, markdown). Related/blocker: https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/issues/4799.\r\n    - <s> Look into redoing default links so that `@` highlight groups mostly link to themselves. Exceptions are the \"core\" ones which should link to Vim's group (not breaking) **or** be defined with colors while Vim's group link to them instead (major breaking for Vim's color schemes). </s>\r\n        Addressed in #27188 and #22981.\r\n\r\n- [X] <s> Consider tweaking filetype plugin highlight groups. One notable example is 'diff' as it [links `diffRemoved` to `Special`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/0d885247b03439ee3aff4c0b9ec095a29bb21759/runtime/syntax/diff.vim#L381) (`diff*`) making patches look unhighlighted (removed) and blue (added). </s>\r\n    Addressed in f46ae1368530389129b5f7f1768c057d5d0b9c2f.\r\n- [x] ~ Fix bundled colorschemes by adding `colorscheme vim` after `hi clear`. ~ Addressed in #26641\r\n- [ ] Update tests to use new color scheme instead of relying on `colorscheme vim`. I am committed to doing it after all highlight groups are settled and some screen test behavior is confirmed to be ok (like using new indexes for attributes instead of replacing previous ones).",

I find that the use of bold for keywords is a bit much: it is distracting and pulls my attention to the parts of the code that are the least important\r\n2. `StatusLine` being darker than `Normal` looks weird to me\r\n3. I wish it had a bit more contrast: the foreground colors are nice and bright, but the background could be darker\r\n4. I wish `Comment` was not dim: comments matter and they should be very readable. Dim colors make more sense for things like inlay hints and other non-critical tokens.\r\n5. I agree that it's a shame that `Search`/`CurSearch` are the same. I understand that this is due to the minimalism of this colorscheme, but I also think that the official, default colorscheme should also serve as a reference, and thus use available Neovim features. It would be a shame to require a custom colorscheme/plugin to make use of a stock Neovim feature.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I've hackily swapped the background values of `Normal` and `StatusLine` and I find that this mostly solves 2 and 3. I don't think that the resulting contrast is too aggressive, but others might disagree. Other highlight groups would have to be adjusted for consistency, but this seems like a good starting point.\r\n\r\nFor context, I currently use the [alabaster](https://github.com/p00f/alabaster.nvim) colorscheme, which is fairly minimalist and high contrast. I recommend reading its README, which provides (IMO) solid arguments to back up its design choices and some of the comments I made above. I do sometimes wish it had a bit more contrast at the end of a long day of work, but its otherwise a very solid minimalist colorscheme.\r\n",

If user (plugin author) wants only text different, then they should use `Diagnostic*` groups. Also (I believe) color scheme authors should redefine `DiagnosticFloating*` to have the same background as `NormalFloat` in their color scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think this is a big issue to revert back to the previous behavior.
