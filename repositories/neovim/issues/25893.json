I'm not talking about the bindings themselves but rather about the state machine that decides what to do when certain commands are executed. \r\n\r\nI found this presentation that mentions vim inspiring: https://speakerdeck.com/nelstrom/modelling-state-machines-with-ragel\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be interesting to explore to what extent the vim state machine can be regularized into a grammar from which C code can be generated that then executes C actions and vim script actions in response to commands.
