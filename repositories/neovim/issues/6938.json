I think it's not a solution, but want to eliminate that possibility.\r\n\r\n> Observe that stty now contains things like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspeed 38400 baud; line = 0;                 \r\n-brkint -icrnl iutf8                        \r\n-isig -iexten    \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat looks like what libtermkey does in `termkey_start()`.\r\n\r\nBut the fact that `jobstart()` is required is weird. We don't alter termios (except for PTY children).\r\n\r\nI think it might be a race: in main.c, `source_startup_scripts()` is called earlier than `ui_builtin_start()`.\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce the issue if you delay the call to `jobstart()` ? E.g., do this part manually (instead of in a startup script):\r\n\r\n    : call jobstart([\"true\"], {\"on_stdout\": function(\"s:Pass\")}) \r\n\r\n",
