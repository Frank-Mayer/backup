I would suggest then\n\n```\nterm://[{user}@{host}][:{cwd}]//[{shell}+{shellcmdflag}+]{args}[#{pid}]\n```\n\n. The `{args}` part is tricky: it is a representation of the arguments _list_ which in some cases _will_ contain things like spaces, `//`, `:`, `+` and other characters. Suggested escaping scheme: separate arguments with `+`, urlencode `+`, `%` and `#` inside arguments, allow urlencoding anything inside arguments and `{shell}+{shellcmdflag}` part. `{cwd}` should never contain trailing directory separator.\n\n`user@host:`, `//{cwd}` and `#{pid}` parts may be omitted when terminal is opened by the user. `{&sh}+{&shcf}+` part is omitted _only_ when terminal is launched without using shell (e.g. `call termopen(['ls'])`, but not `call termopen('ls')`: basically every terminal described by this URI is opened using list syntax, just in case of `call termopen('ls')` `{args}` will be a single argument). After terminal was opened it is always renamed to the _full_ URI:\n\n```\nterm://{user}@{host}:{cwd}//{args}#{pid}\n```\n\nfor saving inside a session file. Still do not understand what’s the reason for `{user}` and `{host}`. `{pid}` may be replaced with `optional-name`, it is not relevant and serves the single purpose of making unique name.\n\nThis variant is mostly different from current scheme by changing meaning and encoding of `{args}` (note: the best thing is changing the encoding), location and meaning of `#{pid}` (only changes how it appears in regex and not anything else) and additions of `{user}@{host}`. `{args}` is the best part of it: currently `call termopen(['ls', '.'])` produces `term://.//{pid}:ls` which is not different from `:term ls`, even though latter is launched using shell and former contains additional argument.\n",

For the same reason I am _not_ separating `{args}` from `{shell}+{shellcmdflag}`: if shell _is_ used it will be part of `{args}`, if shell is not it will not be there.

And the resulting URI is not in a good format, but easily distinguishable.\n\n@justinmk \nHow about just including `join(['cmd', 'cmdflag', 'args'])` in the buffer name? Though it seems only `cmd` is remembered in a session file, which I think can be improved.\n",

That would be easy to implement and executing `#optional-name` in the shell is a comment... though I'm not sure that would work across different shell implementations  \n\nLet's clarify our expectations please let me know if these are correct or if you want me to add to them.\n\n## Expectations:\n\nUsing Just the URI & vim's session\n1. The shell should be able to be restarted with the correct flags\n2. The initial command set passed to the shell should be able to be invoked\n3. The buffer name should be unique\n4. There should be a way to add a easily human readable name.\n\n@ZyX-I \n\n> I ignored the URI scheme because I see no sense in following it: this is NeoVim own format. {args} is one command, because you can’t use :term with more then one command. Basically this is a translation of termopen() call. For the same reason I am not separating {args} from {shell}+{shellcmdflag}: if shell is used it will be part of {args}, if shell is not it will not be there. I do not see where you can get {cmds}, NeoVim cannot track commands that are launched after starting the shell, so {cmds} has no reason to exist.\n\nWell the URI is a good standard to follow. It will be easier for people to figure out what is going on and is a standard already used inside vim (see the scp file edit above). The point of the {cmds} is to separate the arguments passed to the shell when it is started from the initial commands that are run after the shell has begun. For example if I start the bash shell with `--rcfile` and run the command top\n\nI think we could make username@hostname optional but I would like to see it included. I was thinking a little bit more and had some ideas for features. Imagine calling `termopen(['ssh','remoteuser@server.tld', 'ls'])` and then you `gf` on a file name in the buffer and the file is opened in your current neovim session via `scp://remoteuser@server.tld//path/to/document` then you have your local vim setup with all your vimscripts ready to edit the file.\n",
