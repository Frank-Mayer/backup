However:\r\n\r\n- `ce` will change until the end of the current word (before the whitespace), as expected\r\n- `cw` will also change until the end of the current word (before the whitespace) which is unexpected\r\n\r\nGiven that `cw` behavior was copied from vim, and most probably from vi, I’m not sure if this is a bug or a feature request. I know that this will break the habit of some people, but `Y` was fixed to behave as `y$` to be consistent with `D` and `C`, so I hope that `cw` could also be changed to be consistent with `dw`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nPut your cursor in a word, press `cw`. The whitespace after the word should be removed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`cw` should do the same as `dwi` and not `ce`.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nany\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nany\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nall\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nall\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nall\n\n### Installation\n\nall",
