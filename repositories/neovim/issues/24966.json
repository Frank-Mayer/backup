I maintain a project that installs, initializes, and manages multiple Neovim configurations using this feature.\r\n\r\nIn version 0.9 it is possible to specify a path like `neovim/my-cool-config` as the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable value. This is especially nice if you have a lot of Neovim configurations to manage, put them all in a subdirectory of `~/.config`.\r\n\r\nHowever, nightly Neovim has removed this capability. With nightly if you use a path for `NVIM_APPNAME` then you get an error message and nvim exits. The issue where this was decided indicates that `NVIM_APPNAME` was never intended to support paths, simply and strictly the name of a subdirectory in `~/.config`.\r\n\r\nI do not know what the history or reasoning or intent was with implementation of this feature. But it was working pretty nicely and now it's not. What reasons do people have for disallowing support of a path in `NVIM_APPNAME`?</div>",
