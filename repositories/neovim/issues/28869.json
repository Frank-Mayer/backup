This is essentially a breaking change for my workflow.\r\n\r\nA simple fix in my use case was to create my own command:\r\n`vim.api.nvim_create_user_command(\"E\", function () vim.cmd(\"Explore\") end, {})`, however it still feels wrong that the default behaviour has changed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'm not sure on the details of how this would be best implemented, however I don't like that essential Vim built-in commands are conflicting with new additions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Vim built-in ex commands should automatically take priority over ones provided by Neovim.",
