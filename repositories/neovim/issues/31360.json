It doesn't tell us _which_ color changed, only that _some_ color changed (in your case, the cursor), so we end up querying the background color on every mode change. I've opened https://github.com/contour-terminal/contour/issues/1659 to hopefully change this.\n\n>I found that the issue is that my current configuration causes nvim to flash black for a moment before switching to the system/terminal's light color.\n\nThis is interesting.

            "body": "I based it on the light theme for the test because the `background` is set to `dark` by default. The feature of setting the `background` according to terminal color settings has been around for a while, and I had noticed this issue before. It was only after the PR for real-time color changes was merged that I intended to use it, so I tried to figure out the reason. I currently don't have a clear answer because it feels like I spent a lot of time here, but I estimate that the current implementation for accepting color changes is completed through autocmd after nvim starts. \n\nTherefore, when lazy.nvim is loaded, a light color theme interface will never be displayed because it blocks the execution of these autocmds. Moreover, if a line `error()` is used in the `init.lua`, the error message will be displayed in the dark theme, and only after entering will it be light. Sometimes I also feel that `nvim --clean` seems to flash a dark theme for a moment, so it might be better to complete the task of detecting the background earlier. To control variables, the above results are based on the default theme.",
