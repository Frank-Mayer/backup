Admittedly, this could be considered \"an issue with the shell\", but given that tmux, iterm, and other \"shell containers\" behave in one way when a user issues `ctrl-L`, I would expect neovim to behave the same way. Perhaps the easy fix is to have `ctrl-l` map to something that exits terminal mode, moves the buffer up, and re-enters terminal mode, like `<Ctrl-\\><Ctrl-N>zta`, but this does not work as re-entering terminal mode just moves the buffer back into its original place.",
