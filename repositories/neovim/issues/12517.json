You would have to change everything to match the new buffer name.\r\nThis use case is also relevant when using a terminal buffer in normal mode, I don't want to accidently overwrite it with something else.\r\n\r\nPlugin developers cannot make their plugin to act nicely with other plugins as fzf developer describes the problem perfectly in https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/issues/326#issuecomment-282936932\r\n### Reproduce with nvim -u NORC\r\n```\r\nnvim -u NORC\r\ninstall fzf.vim and NERDTree\r\n:NERDTREE (opens nerdtree)\r\nFocus nerdtree buffer\r\n:FZF and choose any file\r\nnerdtree is gone\r\n\r\n```\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nOpening a file when the focus is on a buffer that I would like to keep, the file will be open in a different buffer or a vertical split if there are no more buffers.\r\nMaybe marking buffers with sticky mode which can only be close only with :quit ?\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. nvim -u NORC\r\n2. install fzf.vim and NERDTree\r\n3. :NERDTREE (opens nerdtree)\r\n4. Focus nerdtree buffer\r\n5. Mark buffer as sticky\r\n6. :FZF and choose any file\r\n7. The file is opened in a split \r\n8. Focus nerdtree buffer\r\n9. :FZF and choose any file\r\n10. The file is opened in the same split as in step 7\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a better solution for this problem other than detecting buffer names?\r\n\r\nI'm aware there are mapping to open files in vertical or horizontal split. But the main issue is that I constantly need to know where my focus is and be careful not to overwrite a buffer that I want to keep.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n",

There were two WIP things left in that branch, I left a `PR.md` and `TODO.md` with personal notes that we'd want to remove + rebase/squash away and and a compile warning that I hadn't solved yet.\r\n\r\n```\r\n ../src/nvim/window.c:139:6: warning: function declaration isn’t a prototype [-Wstrict-prototypes]                            \r\n  bool check_can_set_curbuf_disabled()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther than that, my other Neovim-based branch should be in a good state. I'd do the Neovim patch myself but I've never patched to Neovim before and it'd take some time to figure out how to do it properly. If anyone in the know wants to volunteer, I'd appreciate it!",
