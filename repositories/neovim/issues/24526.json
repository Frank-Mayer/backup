For example this is what I saw from `man curl`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       --location‐ trusted\r\n              (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to. This may or may not introduce a security breach if  the  site  redi‐\r\n              rects you to a site to which you will send your authentication info (which is plaintext in the case of HTTP Basic authentication).\r\n\r\n              Providing --location‐ trusted multiple times has no extra effect.  Disable it again with --no‐ location‐ trusted.\r\n\r\n              Example:\r\n               curl ‐ ‐ location‐ trusted ‐ u user:password https://example.com\r\n                                                                           \r\n              See also ‐ u, ‐ ‐ user.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what I saw via v0.7.2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       --location‐trusted\r\n              (HTTP) Like -L, --location, but will allow sending the name + password to all hosts that the site may redirect to.
