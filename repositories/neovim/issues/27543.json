    "body": "It's common for implementations of `map` and `filter` in other languages/libraries to pass the current key/index to the function along with the value. For example, in JavaScript:\r\n\r\n> ### [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/global_objects/array/map) arguments:\r\n>\r\n> - callbackFn: A function to execute for each element in the array. Its return value is added as a single element in the new array. The function is called with the following arguments:\r\n>   - `element`: The current element being processed in the array.\r\n>   - `index`: The index of the current element being processed in the array.\r\n>   - `array`: The array `map()` was called upon.\r\n\r\nI've run into a few cases where having the current key would be helpful in the map callback function.\r\n\r\nI started working on a PR for this, but adding these arguments causes unrelated tests to fail. I suppose this would be a breaking change, since it could negatively affect callback functions that aren't expecting additional arguments. Is this something you think we can add, or no?",
