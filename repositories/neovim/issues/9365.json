I recently started experimenting with KDE Plasma Wayland session, checking what features are still missing in the overall experience. One thing I noticed is that obviously xsel is useless for Wayland clipboard so nvim loses system clipboard feature.\r\n\r\nIs there any plan to implement Wayland clipboard integration?",
