    "body": "### Problem\n\nI'm sorry if this report comes off as a bit confusing but I'm uncertain what to make of the situation.\r\n\r\nNeovim now calls ` ts_query_cursor_set_max_start_depth()` function which appears to have been introduced in tree-sitter 0.20.9. Neovim attempts to check the minimum version of tree-sitter but the check fails to detect whether a recent enough version of tree-sitter is actually available.\r\n\r\nAFAICT, Neovim gets the version information from the pkg-config file `tree-sitter.pc`. The file gets generated by tree-sitter's [Makefile](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/Makefile). The actual tree-sitter library version set by the Makefile is 0.20.10, a change introduced by commit [0e4ff0b](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/commit/0e4ff0bb27edf37b76fc7d35aa768b02cf4392ad). It seems like the versions of tree-sitter and the tree-sitter library that Neovim checks are not the same thing and Neovim fails to build with no obvious reason.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1) Get the latest neovim source code\r\n2) Get the latest tree-sitter source code and revert it to the latest commit before v0.20.9 version tag\r\n3) Attempt to build neovim against such tree-sitter\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim should either build or report that the available version of tree-sitter is too old. Currently, it seems that too old versions of tree-sitter are not detected as such during Neovim's configuration.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n74e695d22715e52f5561a185583b8c23d4fa0dd6\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nN/A\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from source",
