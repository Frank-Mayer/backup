    "body": "### Problem\n\n`:help cpo-$` says:\r\n\r\n> When making a change to one line, don't redisplay the line, but put a '$' at\r\n> the end of the changed text. The changed text will be overwritten when you\r\n> type the new text.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would love if Neovim instead of placing a `$` at the end of the changed text, gave the changed text a custom highlight. That way I could for instance make the changed text underlined or give it a different background color. This could be a new `cpo` option, like `cpo-h` for instance.\r\n\r\n**Desired behaviour:**\r\n\r\n1. Press `cw` at the start of the word `foobar`\r\n2. The word `foobar` gets a custom highlight, let's call it `ChangedText`\r\n3. Type `baz`\r\n4. The line now says `bazbar`. `baz` doesn't have the `ChangedText` highlight, but the rest of the word (`bar`) still does\r\n5. Press `<esc>`\r\n6. The rest of the word (`bar`) dissappears, and therefore also its `ChangedText` highlight\r\n7. ...\r\n8. Profit?\r\n",
