However, I believe the root cause to be a bug in neovim itself.\r\n\r\nThe documentation states that `vim.fn.jobstart(cmd)` creates a subprocess with the appended environment variable $NVIM pointing to `v:servername` (the parent nvim instance). As far as I can tell, this works fine on native Linux and macOS. On WSL Distros, the env var appears to be unset:\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n(0. Be on WSL)\r\n\r\n1. Start nvim with minimal config\r\n``` \r\ninit.lua\r\n---\r\nvim.fn.jobstart(\"tail -f /dev/null\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Use a tool like htop to figure out the PID of the child process\r\n\r\n3. Observe environment of the given process\r\n```\r\n$ cat /proc/<PID>/environ | tr '\\0' '\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. $NVIM is not set\r\n\r\nI can reproduce this with the latest neovim stable and nightly builds. Personally, I use Ubuntu WSL, but my understanding from the comments in the original (neogit) issue is that this happens on several, if not all, WSL distros.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can be of further assistance in debugging this issue!\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n(0.
