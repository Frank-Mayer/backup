    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nAs it stands today, `:messages` command output is hackable in lua, however there is *no way* to be able to obtain/hack the output of the **last command** in lua, **or any command for that matter**. I've read all the possible documentation on this subject, please let me know if there is a way to achieve this. One cannot associate a certain command that has been run in the past to certain output/historical message(s) neither, although neovim keeps such information under the hood without exposing it publicly. \r\n\r\nThis significantly reduces the surface area of neovim customizability. Therefore, I think it is a bug rather than a feature request. We must have `:message` command available in Ex in addition to `:messages`. \r\n\r\n- There is *no way* to get the output of `g<` in a buffer with lua in neovim today.\r\n- Today `:messages` command outputs all messages in history **with no separation**/indicator between outputs, for any developer to be able to determine what were the last messages of a certain command.\r\n- In fact, today as it seems neovim doesn't expose this information publicly in the runtime. The data is hidden inside `void show_sb_text(void) {}` of `src/nvim/message.c`\r\n- In functional tests of neovim this data is tested against a very custom/private/internal `Screen::assert()` test method. Example of its usage is in: `test/functional/ui/messages_spec.lua: < shows blank line from :echo properly'`\r\n\r\n\r\nThis limits the possibility to customize the UI of `g<` and developers cannot build advanced execution plugins/behavior like:\r\n- Select only certain area of a lua file in existing buffer, run it and show the output on a vertical split.\r\n- Show the last command output that I had run few seconds ago with `:`, show it on a separate window, without leaving my current buffer position, without using `g<`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nnvim file.txt\r\n\r\n`:=vim.print({'a', 'b', 'c'})`\r\n\r\nHit enter.\r\n\r\nNo way to determine what was the last output of a command. `:messages` shows all the gathered messages without any proper separator to be able to obtain the last output(not the line, entire output) in lua.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`:message` command, that outputs `g<` so `vim.fn.execute`, `vim.api.exec2() ` can get this string output in lua.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nyes\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux x1-carbon 6.9.4-arch1-1 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Wed, 12 Jun 2024 20:17:17 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nalacritty 0.13.2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\ntmux-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nnixpkgs",

Also, this request is too limited. We need something more general. \r\n\r\nThe entire messages history should be available, plus timestamps, highlights, log-level, etc. As a first step, it might make sense to expose this as a callback/event, that is powerful while leaving the door open for a more complete API later.\r\n\r\nIs this not already possible with `vim.ui_attach()` ?\r\n\r\nPartially related to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/7062",
