In these docs, its mentioned that this would be the case on American keyboard https://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/editing.html#CTRL-^.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not have an American keyboard layout and none of my other keys is switched around or wrong. Its only that alt file feature that takes 6 instead of ^ on my German keyboard.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNot entirely sure how to reproduce reliably.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`CTRL-^` should toggle the alternate-file\r\n\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-700+gbcae8be91\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nyes, vim 9.0\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nwindows 10, 5.15.153.1-microsoft-standard-WSL2 GNU/Linux, Bookworm\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWindows Terminal Version: 1.20.11781.0\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nrepo",
