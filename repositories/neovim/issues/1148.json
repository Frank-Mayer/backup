While I don't normally try to micromanage the compiler, \"-fstop-being-stupid\" is a thing you have to hit gcc with from time to time.\n\nSince we don't interface with C++ libs that I know of, it sounds like a good idea.

It seems gcc sometimes uses a static table for this, and other times inserts unwind instructions at the call site.\n\nI tested this and found it does seem to shrink it a bit (5,663,765 vs 5,633,221), but not by 10%.
