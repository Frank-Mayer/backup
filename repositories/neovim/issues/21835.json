This means that long errors, such as those reported by C++ compilers are truncated and I need to invoke build manually from the command line to see the full error message.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been implemented in regular vim via [this PR](https://github.com/vim/vim/pull/11357), so it would be great if someone could port that here, or implement the same feature differently.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect to be able to read my error messages, regardless of their length.\r\n\r\nThis means that either the default line length of the qflist is unlimited or that there is a way to configure that in `init.lua`.",
