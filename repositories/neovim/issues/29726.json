The reason I am reporting here is because of the discrepancy in errors between the two commands. The file is from [HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim](https://github.com/hiphish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim).\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open the file in Neovim\r\n2. Execute `:InspectTree`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo errors in `:InspectTree`\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nBoth `NVIM v0.10.0` and `NVIM v0.11.0-dev-422+g3c803483a`\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nVoid Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.13.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nAppImage",
