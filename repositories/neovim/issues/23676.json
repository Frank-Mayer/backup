    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nHello. I'm new to vim plugins, as well as I am new to C# language. I'm trying to set up a C# environment in NeoVim and I'm having troubles with the `csharp-ls` engine. First of all, it's difficult for me to understand to which repo I should really write this issue, so do excuse me if I chose wrong and please let me know where should I post this instead.\r\n\r\nI have filed an issue on lsp-zero repository before and so far it seems like it's a problem with NeoVim's built-in fuction.\r\nBut, of course, it might be the problem with my configuration.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\nI created a new \"webapi\" preset via `dotnet new webapi` and opened `Program.cs` file in NeoVim.\r\nWhenever I hover over almost anything, like, for example, `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)`, no matter which part of it exactly, and when I press `gd` in normal mode (which is mapped to `vim.lsp.buf.definition()`) I get this error message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError executing vim.schedule lua callback: /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/util.\r\nlua:1828: index out of range\r\nstack traceback:\r\n        [C]: in function '_str_byteindex_enc'\r\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/util.lua:1828: in function 'locations_to_items'\r\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/handlers.lua:398: in function 'handler'\r\n        /usr/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp.lua:1394: in function 'cb'\r\n        vim/_editor.lua:263: in function <vim/_editor.lua:262>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some other C# projects it's not guaranteed to get this error, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but in the new webapi preset pressing `gd` on virtually any method that is within the stock `Program.cs` file results in this.\r\n\r\nI have no idea how can I even start debugging this. I'm going to link to my current nvim config files, because I might have done something stupid:\r\nhttps://git.sr.ht/~ztx/nix-cfg/tree/bedrock-pc/item/files/home/.config/nvim\r\n\r\nI did try to uninstall all other plugins with the exception of `lsp-config`, `mason` and `cmp` related stuff, as well as I have tried to reinstall everything several times, I've tried minimal configs, such as this one:\r\nhttps://paste.sh/4PPgollR#iNvYdoqsTyvfrJa0VGFxgMU4\r\nbut the result is always the same.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on what's going on? Any additional info I should provide?\r\nHere's the NVim's `:version` info - https://paste.sh/Z1tT5b5f#h0K3_aRL7s8JSohzJaSjNfLp\r\nThe LSP log is empty as of now.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.9.0\r\n\r\n### Language server name/version\r\n\r\ncsharp-ls 0.8.0\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nVoid Linux",
