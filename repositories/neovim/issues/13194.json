Plus, given the amount of automated junk we all receive every day, I'm sure they'll be happy to receive a hand-crafted email, even if it's about a bug.\r\n\r\n>I'm unsure how to lookup their github usernames from their emails though\r\n\r\nYou could try creating fake commits with their emails in one of your repositories and seeing if Github resolves that to an account. If this doesn't work you could try sending an email to Vim's mailing list, perhaps the syntax file's authors are subscribed to that.\r\n\r\nI'll close this issue because Neovim won't do anything about it until it's fixed in Vim, but feel free to keep using it for questions/guidance :).",
