It would be nice if the window IDs were passed in the callback argument table.\r\n\r\nThis is sort of done in `WinClosed`, with the ID of the window to be closed being passed in as a string in `ev.file` and `ev.match`. I'm not sure why it does this, perhaps an oversight when they were originally implemented in vim?\r\n\r\n`WinClosed` doesn't pass the ID at all.\r\n\r\nI have only used these two events, but I'm assuming this is also the case for all Win* events. Is there a reason this isn't already a thing? Am I misunderstanding the use of the callback argument?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWindow ID of window to be opened/closed should be passed as an integer in the callback event argument table.\r\nI found the documentation quite unclear on this, but I believe it should be passed as an integer in `ev.data`. This shouldn't break backwards compatibility, as this would simply be an addition to the current argument table.",
