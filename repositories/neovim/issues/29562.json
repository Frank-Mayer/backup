    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nThanks for making neovim, which is by far my favorite editor. But after the update to 0.10.0 I found myself in the fog: The contrast was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the default configuration and a light terminal, the new terminal colors have extremely low contrast.\r\nThe contrast is even lower since the background is very dark.\r\nTo distinguish some colors, I have to take a close look, and thus they slow down very much parsing/scanning code with my eyes. I have normal eyesight. So, if someone has any issue with their eyes, it is basically like viewing through the fog and trying to read.\r\n\r\nFor the background, why should I artificially constrain the dynamic range of my screen in software? If I want my screen to be darker (and have less contrast), I can dim it and save energy.\r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\n![nvim colors default](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/4646725/5e55f319-233d-4419-a160-03f5a04b5452)\r\n![nvim colors default config](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/4646725/f5a2e467-2023-452f-b01f-a7b4abfbbeb6)\r\n\r\nIn the first two lines of the second example, is `zathura` the same type of thing as the comment? No. Are the colors distinguishable? No.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, the `nvim-qt` colors are much better.\r\n![nvim colors default nvim-qt](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/4646725/90ae08ee-1b36-458b-bdbd-a01215bed07d)\r\n![nvim-qt colors default config](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/4646725/916afd83-e2cb-42e3-830d-27453e704899)\r\n\r\n`:colorscheme vim` has a similar effect. Of course, colorscheme vim has its weaknesses, e.g. it is unusable with light background and vimdiff.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nnvim --clean\r\nin nvim, type `:help`\r\n\r\nFor comparison, run nvim-qt, e.g. or set `:colorscheme vim`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe default should rather be high contrast than low contrast for accessibility reasons.\r\n\r\nColors should be clearly distinguishable and everything have sufficient contrast (brightness and color contrast) so that reading and scanning is easy.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.10.0\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno, the default color scheme is different there anyway\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nNixOS 24.05\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nxterm 390\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm/xterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\ninstall with home-manager from nixpkgs-unstable",
