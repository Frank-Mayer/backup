Till now, it was using Komac, built by one of WinGet's moderators, but I would like to keep the control in my hands, and would not like to depend on some other person. Sometimes, bugs take exceedingly long to fix and due to that, the failed runs of the action increases which I don't like at all.",

To be clear, this is less to do with success/failure rate of the workflow and more about setting the correct expectations that neovim is not directly responsible for winget releases, as well as enforcing our (admittedly non-written) policies around not letting distribution-specific code unless necessary. We are very grateful for the work you've put in so far, and we would be delighted to continue to have neovim on winget if you have the time and energy to follow up.\r\n\r\nWe have created `https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases` specifically for releases we would like but are hesitant to support officially and I think winget would be perfect there. Even though it's still under the neovim organization I believe the separation, as well as the README disclaimer should make it clear that it's provided on a best effort basis. I have created https://github.com/neovim/neovim-releases/pull/8 which I believe should be fully functional and equivalent to the workflow we had. I think everything is finished except for creating the necessary credential which I'm unsure about. If you want to take a look at it/help out that would be awesome!",
