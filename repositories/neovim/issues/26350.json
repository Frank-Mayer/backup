    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nToday I saw an issue in `rainbow-delimiters` about highlighting while using `vim.treesitter.foldtext()` [ HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim/issues/71 ], and I have also filed a similar issue in `nvim-treesitter-context` some time ago [ nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-context/issues/358 ], so I thought I would collect the idea of what I would want from neovim, if possible, here. (If there is already a way to do something like this, could anyone point me in the right direction?)\r\n\r\nThe main problem is this: For these types of features, where you reproduce a subset of the characters from multiple lines, is there any easy way to keep the extmarks/highlights with the text?\r\n\r\nTo be more specific, I will just focus on `vim.treesitter.foldtext()`. Would it be possible to easily keep the highlighting of say `(` and `)` coming from `rainbow-delimiters` if I fold something like this (made up simple example):\r\n```lua\r\ntest(\r\n  a,\r\n  b,\r\n  c,\r\n)\r\n```\r\nto this:\r\n```lua\r\ntest( ... )\r\n```\r\n(Since not everyone might want this, this probably involves some way to optionally include the highlights.)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOptionally keep the extmark highlights of e.g. parentheses when folding (or doing other similar operations).
