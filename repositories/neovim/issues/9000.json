With the default value for `'completeopt'`, the full text for the first match is inserted.\r\n> \r\n> If you press `<C-e>` to cancel the completion, then whatever text you've explicitly typed remains, instead of what was inserted by the completion.\r\n> \r\n> If you press `<C-y>` to accept the completion, it remains and the cursor is at the end of the text.\r\n> \r\n> Otherwise, you can continue to type to refine the matches.\r\n> \r\n> The only difference is that the animations you show leave the cursor at the end of the text that the user has typed and shows the completed text after the cursor (and faded).  There's no functional difference, just eye candy.",
