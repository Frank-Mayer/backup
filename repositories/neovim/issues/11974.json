You can force your N/Vim colorscheme to use ANSI color indexes: \r\n\r\n    :highlight Comment ctermfg=Red\r\n\r\nThen changing ANSI \"red\" to some other color in your terminal, will color comments as such. Note that this requires `:set notermguicolors`.\r\n\r\nThe `t_xx` inner-platform is not supported. `:help t_xx`\r\n\r\n\r\n> 5\\. Observe `Segmentation fault` (without Step 2 this does not happen).\r\n\r\nIs `set t_Co=16` required to repro that? If that happens with  the [development version](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) please open a new report including a [backtrace](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/FAQ#backtrace-linux).",
