In any case, the application is guaranteed to receive an overflow\r\n    notification which can be handled to gracefully recover.  `fswatch`\r\n    currently throws an exception if a queue overflow occurs.  Future versions\r\n    will handle the overflow by emitting proper notifications.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAlso can be adjusted and fixed with something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/a/62501929/4915340\r\n\r\nMaybe including the config in the error message is worthwhile or having like :h fswatch include it and error reference it?",
