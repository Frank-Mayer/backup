    "body": "### Problem\n\nI am on windows and set up neovim using lazyvim. I have enabled a few different LSP's and they all seem to throw a similar error. In the UI I get the following notification \r\n`Warn  3:34:57 PM notify.warn Client 1 quit with exit code 1 and signal 0`\r\nwhen I look in the lsp.log file I see errors like the following for multiple LSP's:\r\n```\r\n[ERROR][2024-03-19 15:17:48] .../vim/lsp/rpc.lua:734\t\"rpc\"\t\"C:/Users/FIRSTNAME(STRING)LASTNAME/AppData/Local/nvim-data/mason/bin/lua-language-server.CMD\"\t\"stderr\"\t\"'C:/Users/FIRSTNAME' is not recognized as an internal or external command,\\r\\noperable program or batch file.\\r\\n\"\r\n```\r\nWhere it appears to truncate the path the exe(?guessing) in the referenced batch script when attempting to run it to before the parenthesis in the path. \r\n\r\nContents of the batch file mentioned in the error:\r\n``` batch\r\n@ECHO off\r\nGOTO start\r\n:find_dp0\r\nSET dp0=%~dp0\r\nEXIT /b\r\n:start\r\nSETLOCAL\r\nCALL :find_dp0\r\n\r\nendLocal & goto #_undefined_# 2>NUL || title %COMSPEC% & \"C:\\Users\\FIRSTNAME(STRING)LASTNAME\\AppData\\Local\\nvim-data\\mason\\packages\\lua-language-server\\bin/lua-language-server.exe\" %*\r\n```\r\n\r\nI attempted to modify the cmd scripts myself to:\r\n* Leverage a variable in the execution of the exe, replacing part of the fully qualified path with system variables that were listed when running `set` in a CMD terminal (ie. `%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%`) in the batch script shared above.\r\n* `cd` to the path first then execute the exe \r\n* escape the `(` using `^` \r\n* escape `\"` using `^`\r\n* Change all slashes to be the same (ie. `\\`) \r\n\r\nHowever it did not appear that editing these batch files mentioned in the lsp.log errors actually did anything. Even if I restarted the LSP server or my computer. They appeared as if I had made no change to them at all, still giving the same exact error. \r\n\r\nAdditionally I tried setting `shellslash` to true in the options.lua along with the settings listed in the [help for shell](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'shell') to specify using powershell to see if that helped, no effect.\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nI can reproduce the issue by adding a config that defines the lua-language-server as an LSP to use, then trying to edit a lua file (in my case this is generally one of the lazy lua config files. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLSP's load and start working as expected leveraging the cmd scripts and the exe files they are attempting to run. \n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.5\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nmultiple \n\n### Operating system/version\n\nEdition\tWindows 10 Enterprise Version\t22H2 Installed on\t‎8/‎9/‎2022 OS build\t19045.4046 Experience\tWindows Feature Experience Pack 1000.19053.1000.0\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
