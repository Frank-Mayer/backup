    "body": "### Problem\n\nThere appears to be no easy way to get the field name of a TSNode; that is, the name its parent has assigned it. The only way to get it is something like\r\n```lua\r\nfunction field_of(node)\r\n  for child, field in node:parent():iter_children()\r\n    if child == node then\r\n      return field\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is awkward and inefficient, being linear to number of siblings. In C, I believe it could be implemented in constant time as\r\n```c\r\nchar* field_of(TSNode node) {\r\n  TSTreeCursor cursor = ts_tree_cursor_new(node);\r\n  char* name = ts_tree_cursor_current_field_name(&cursor);\r\n  ts_tree_cursor_delete(&cursor);\r\n  return name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This snippet is untested.)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThere should exist a function that returns the field name of the TSNode, possibly implemented as above (with some extra Lua wrapping). The most obvious name would be `TSNode:field()`, but unfortunately this name is already taken by the function that returns all children that are the given field, so another name would need to be chosen.",

The new API isn't exposed through Lua yet; we can only do this after a release.)",

Turns out TSCursor doesn't want to go above the given start node, including to get field names, so `ts_tree_cursor_current_field_name()` on a newly-created TSCursor just returns null. \r\n\r\n`ts_node_field_name_for_child()` does seem relevant, but I don't see any function to find a child's index in its parent, so even with that we'd have to fall back to a linear scan.\r\n\r\nSo I guess we might as well close this issue, unless someone wants to file an issue for a `ts_node_index_in_parent()` function.",
