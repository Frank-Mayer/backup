    "body": "### Problem\n\nThere appears to be no easy way to get the field name of a TSNode; that is, the name its parent has assigned it. The only way to get it is something like\r\n```lua\r\nfunction field_of(node)\r\n  for child, field in node:parent():iter_children()\r\n    if child == node then\r\n      return field\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is awkward and inefficient, being linear to number of siblings. In C, I believe it could be implemented in constant time as\r\n```c\r\nchar* field_of(TSNode node) {\r\n  TSTreeCursor cursor = ts_tree_cursor_new(node);\r\n  char* name = ts_tree_cursor_current_field_name(&cursor);\r\n  ts_tree_cursor_delete(&cursor);\r\n  return name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(This snippet is untested.)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThere should exist a function that returns the field name of the TSNode, possibly implemented as above (with some extra Lua wrapping). The most obvious name would be `TSNode:field()`, but unfortunately this name is already taken by the function that returns all children that are the given field, so another name would need to be chosen.",
