My expectation when performing these actions is that the dot operator would repeat the last action `viwP` instead of deleting the last character off the current word.\r\n\r\nI am suggesting this as a feature and not a bug because the same behavior happens in Vim.\r\n\r\nMy current workaround is to repeatedly type `viwP` rather than use the dot operator.",

Instead it should be changed work like you imply: it should repeat the visual-mode steps, not a fixed range box. This is tracked in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16296",
