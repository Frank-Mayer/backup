Otherwise it will remain forever in the file. You can only get rid of it if you use :wshada!.\nIf you use :wshada! to store the actual markers a complete new main.shada is written so you loose all the information of the other files.  \n### Steps to reproduce\n\nnvim -u NONE testfile\nhack hack hack\nset marker b on e.g. line 10 in command mode with:\n10ggmb\nclose file and reopen\nshow marks with:\n:marks\ndelete marker b with:\ndelmark b\nclose file and reopen\nshow marks again with:\n:marks\n",

After closing the file as I described above the marks were correctly saved if editing the file with vim. But neovim shows a different behavior. If editing a file with neovim the marks that I have deleted are not saved after closing the file, so that all marks are visible again after reopening it and they can only be deleted with :!wshada but this destroys the main shade file so that the marks from the other files are also removed. vim and I think in an older version of neovim too, I currently don't know the exact version number, don't show this behavior so I think this feature is currently not correctly implemented.\nIf you think it is, can you please describe me a method of how to do this?\nThank you very much.\n",

To delete register one may simply write “empty” characterwise register (actually, not truly “empty”, but “with a single empty line”, but this is insignificant differences) and stay compatible. Current specification does not allow creating “deleted” marks without breaking backward compatibility, so to be compatible one will need to add “deleted {local,global} mark” ShaDa items in place of reusing existing items used for marks.\n2. Writing “deleted local mark” items given the fact that ShaDa may contain many files will bloat the ShaDa file. There are not that much registers to worry about.\n3. Non-empty register may cause problems when `@r` is accidentally typed (and I sometimes do this). I do not see any problems with not deleted marks except that `:marks` output will be longer.\n",

This plugin\nallows me to visualize the valid markers set in a file e.g. with a highlighted\nline. So when studying and editing code it often happens to me that I set\nmarkers for code positions that are interesting for me in order to quickly find\nthe positions again and to jump to them. Then e.g. at the end of the day I\nclose the file and some times later after reopening it I would like to see the\nmarks again. So far so good. Everything is fine, marks are saved and even\nsetting an already setted mark to a different location is also. So after I've\nfinished with a feature I'd like to delete some marks I'm not interested in\nanymore. But other marks that are still interesting I don't won't them to be\ndeleted. So again after closing and reopening the file the previous deleted\nmarks are still present and not cleared. This is not the way vim behave. Vim\nwouldn't show the deleted marks anymore. If neovim would follow this behavior\nof vim again I would be very happy.\n\nIf you need some settings of my vimrc or additional information please let me\nnow and I will happily post them.\n\nAgain thanks very much for caring.\n",

True if the mark has been deleted, false or empty otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe first solution should be totally backward compatible, given that the deleted entry has some timestamp, so any mark older than the deleted entry should be ignored and the ones more recent should be picked up by the newer nvim version, whatever the nvim version you created your mark with. However it has a bit of overhead as you need a distinct entry from the {Global,Local}  mark entry type.\r\n\r\nThe second solution feels more straight-forward to me as you have all the informations you need in one entry. The inconvenient is that it's not backward compatible: if an old nvim instance create or modify a previously deleted mark, it will not modify the deleted key, and so, the more recent version of nvim will not picked it up.\r\n\r\nI don't know what should be the prefered way here.",
