The winbar should stay in place when scrolling, but we don't know which lines are affected, so it would scroll with the rest of the window, and then finally probably snap into the right location when the screen is updated.\r\n\r\nFor more information see some of the reports in my PR for Neovide here https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/1790\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf winbar had its own window id, like all the other windows, like tabbars, status bars, command line and so on this would not be a problem.",

But there have been much fewer reports about it, since very few plugins actually use that feature.\r\n\r\nBut I have been busy with finally getting things ready for a new Neovide release. And one of the things is a very hacky way to get it working with the current released neovim version.\r\n* https://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2165\r\n\r\nMy solution is based on detecting the highlight groups, which are in no way guaranteed, but that's the only information we have currently. So, with that a line with only float borders is considered a top or bottom border, and so is any line with at least one winbar highlight.\r\n\r\nThere's also the problem that the `ext_hlstate` only reports the names of the final highlight group in case of links, so another hack had to be done to work around that:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovide/neovide/pull/2165/files#diff-96e67d744565c0dc461711b437b734a4d58cdc3ddac82c61fe7d722db3573f9bR106-R121\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things that I think are documented wrong about the `hl_state`, and indicated so by comments in that PR.",

I have not been able to determine the cause of this problem, but I have confirmed that in configurations where this problem occurs, there is a delay in the opening of float windows that is not negligible to the user's experience. \r\nAlso, if the top content is expanded to be richer in the future, this approach will break down because the UI does not know how much area needs to be fixed.\r\n\r\nI also believe that Neovim itself should be corrected in this case.",
