If I yank something in nvim and then paste it in notepad it will correctly paste the content inline but in nvim it will always add it to a newline.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought the issue was me doing something wrong or maybe a config was wrong but the issue also happens with a clean config and doesn't happen when using `gvim`.\r\n\r\nI'm very new to the vim world so I apologize if this is expected behaviour.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to share a minimal reproduction since it involves manually copying from something outside of nvim.\r\n\r\nHere's a short video showing what happens:\r\nLeft is gvim, middle is neovim inside of windows terminal, right is notepad. I used `p` to paste in vim and neovim. Both vim and nvim have `:set clipboard=unnamedplus`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/8348954/3fddf865-def1-43b0-beb6-bd3f394a6a69\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n```lua\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:set clipboard=unnamedplus\r\n\r\n-- copy something from notepad without any newlines\r\n\r\n-- move the neovim cursor in the middle of a line of text\r\n-- also happens with `p` or `P`\r\n:put\r\n\r\n-- the content will be added to a new line instead of next to the cursor\r\n```\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect neovim to paste inline when the content of the clipboard doesn't have a newline.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nv0.9.1\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno. vim 9.0\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Version 22H2\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWindows Terminal, Neovide\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nempty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nscoop",
