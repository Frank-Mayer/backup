    "body": "### Problem\n\nI needed to perform an LSP replace using the same pattern on different files on a project. Easy enough: `live_grep` with `Telescope`, send to quickfix, `cdo` with some positioning and then running `vim.lsp.buf.rename(\"newName\")`, right? Unfortunately it does not work, it only changes the last file in a broken way.\r\n\r\nIt took me a bit to realize that `vim.lsp.buf.rename` works asynchronously. I don't exactly understand _why_ the problem manifests itself in this particular way, but anyway using a _sync_ approach for the operation is probably the right thing to when performing this sort of automation.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe documentation should suggest to avoid using `rename` for scripting purposes, and it should suggest its _sync_ alternative (which obviously should exist). I am not totally sure if the behavior should depend on a parameter (similarly to `vim.lsp.buf.format`, but using `async = true` by default instead) or if it should be a separated function (i.e. `vim.lsp.buf.rename_sync`). In theory, it could be also helpful to have a _callback_ parameter to the current `rename` function to be called after the operation ends, however this is not so useful when using `cdo` and similar functions, therefore out of scope for this issue.",
