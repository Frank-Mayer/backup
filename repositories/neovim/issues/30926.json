    "body": "### Problem\n\nSince commit 0083e03d6, `vim.lsp.buf.definition` does not seem to set the tag stack. This results in things like `C-o` being completely broken and jumping back to random places.\n\nSeems this is also a known issue as mentioned in #30877 as well. \n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWith an LSP server like `clangd` or `rust-analyzer`, jump to a function definition with `vim.lsp.buf.definition` and then press `C-o`. Cursor does not come back to the initial location from where `vim.lsp.buf.definition` was triggered.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nJumping with `vim.lsp.buf.definition` and then pressing `C-o` should jump back to the initial location.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-1035+g50e63c817\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty 0.14.0 (22a44757)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from repo",
