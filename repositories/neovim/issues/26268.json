Ideally, the language server will be able to install and manage addons defined in a setting by simply providing the git clone URLs. This would hopefully be cross-platform and super easy for all users.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will be implemented, then users (or nvim-lspconfig) can point to the metafile URL.
