But the problem is that users do not usually set this variable. If this variable is set by the system administrator in the system config such as `bash.bashrc`, this env variable will be inherited by the user, which causes the error message shown above.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is saner to first try to derive the value of $VIM from the location of nvim executable.",

Why install software in `/etc` ?\r\n\r\nI guess as part of the detection mechanism (as in the quoted `:h $VIM` ), we could try to detect a _nvim_ runtime as opposed to a _vim_ runtime. Only if no nvim runtime is found, or if you directly set `VIMRUNTIME` to it, would we ever try to load a vim runtime (I guess you might want to be able to do this, for some weird debugging purpose or something).",

In addition, I very much question the use of exporting $VIM systemwide. Vim and Neovim are perfectly able to figure out their required environment.

It is just that Vim configuration is put in `/etc/vim`.\r\n\r\nInstead of setting `$VIM`, which is overkill for this task, the distribution should include `/etc/vim` as part of the default `'runtimepath'`.  Debian does [just this](https://salsa.debian.org/vim-team/vim/blob/debian/sid/debian/rules#L28) (along with the additional `/var/lib/vim/addons`, which is specific to a Debian tool).\r\n\r\nPrevious to being able to use `--with-global-runtime` with multiple paths (added in [v8.1.0612](https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/9d302ad4e31b4e20ce0b3af700f43edb6f5e6036)), Debian had a file in `$VIMRUNTIME` which was sourced by the system-wide vimrc to adjust `'runtimepath'`.\r\n\r\n_Either_ of these choices is _much_ better than hard-coding `$VIM` in the system shell files.",
