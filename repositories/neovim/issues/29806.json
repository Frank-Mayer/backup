Using macOS default Terminal.app. Also tested in different Terminal.app color schemes and couldn't find anything that worked.\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nnvim --clean +':set cursorline cursorcolumn colorcolumn=+1' +':norm 5Oxxxxx' +':norm 3G0ll'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen `:colorscheme vim` and note the difference.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe current line is underlined or highlighted in some way, as is the current column.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.0, v0.11.0-dev-470+gadef830f8\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno (N/A)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS Sonoma 14.5\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nApple Terminal 2.14 (453)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nGitHub releases, nvim-macos-arm64",
