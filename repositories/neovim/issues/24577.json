I also have a similar issue in telescope where pressing enter to open the file I chose in the fuzzy finder will move the cursor all the way down and break the prompt instead of opening the file (Although I marked this as a netrw issue as telescope is a third party plugin).\r\n\r\nIn insert mode I have the expected behavior however.\r\n\r\nThis issue only happens in kitty, if I use another terminal emulator like the XFCE terminal I have the expected behavior.\r\n\r\nI use a French AZERTY keyboard and I suspect this may play a role in this issue as I've never experienced this on my main machine which has a QWERTY keyboard.\r\n\r\nI also posted an issue on kitty git, and the maintainer indicated me that it may be related to the implementation of the Kitty Keyboard Protocol in Neovim.\r\n[Kitty issue #6527](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/6527)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Open neovim in kitty terminal.\r\n- Use `:Explore` to open netrw.\r\n- Select a file and press enter to open it.\r\n- The cursor should move down.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPressing enter in netrw should open a file or change directory.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1-1.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nVim 9.0.1632-2.1. No but it has another issue which was filed here: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/12731\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nOpenSUSE Tumbleweed\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.29.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nSystem package manager (zypper, official repositories)",
