When I move the mouse (up, down, left, right), my terminal screen displays a \"flicker.\" Here are the specifications I'm using:\r\n\r\n- **Ubuntu:** 22.04 LTS  \r\n- **Terminal:** WezTerm 20240203-110809-5046fc22  \r\n- **Neovim:** v0.10.1\r\n- **Tmux:** 3.2a\r\n\r\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue? I've attached a video to better demonstrate the problem I'm facing.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49eb4c9f-21a1-4e76-b991-21c86100afd2\r\n\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- I have tried updating the Neovim version from the previous one: v0.9*.\r\n- I have tried various terminals (Ubuntu Terminal, Alacritty, Kitty, WezTerm).\r\n\r\nBut the problem still persists.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nMy expectation when using Neovim, whether an LSP is embedded or not, is that when I move the cursor, it should simply move without any \"flicker\" or \"weird rendering\" occurring on my terminal screen.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, 8.2.2121\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04.4 LTS x86_64\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20240203-110809-5046fc22\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nrepo apt",
