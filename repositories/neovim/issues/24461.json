A floating window would want to take your focus but a \"popup\" is supplementary to the current window though we have no way of distinguishing between them when using `NormalNC`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nHaving a way to distinguish between floats and popups.\r\n\r\nI had thought of 3 solutions but only 1 of them seems viable currently:\r\n\r\n1. **Add the ability to change the LSP highlight defaults**.\r\n\t- This has the issue of themes needing to alter user config settings.\r\n\r\n2. **Add NormalFloatNC**.\r\n\t- At first i thought this would be a good idea but how do you control the background for the border and title, doesn't seem viable.\r\n\r\n3. **Add a property when setting highlights that would allow that highlight group to be effected by NormalNC.**\r\n\t- I'm unsure of the complexity of this solution but currently it seems like the most flexible option something like `nc = true`.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks for reading my ramble looking forward to getting crushed by reality! üèãÔ∏è ",
