    "body": "### Problem\n\nTreesitter often (always?) includes everything in some top level node, but that top level node is not included in `:InspectTree`. It would be nice to have at least the name of the top level node in `:InspectTree`, since it varies for each language.\r\n\r\nE.g. in a Lua file using `:lua= vim.treesitter.get_node():parent():type()` on the first line of a comment on its own line, we can see that `chunk` is the top level node, but `chunk` is nowhere in the `:InspectTree` tree.\r\n\r\nI assume that this might have been done on purpose to avoid having a huge tree inside a single top level node, which makes sense, but I would like the information to be available somehow. It could be something as simple as: `\"Top level node: chunk` at the beginning of `:InspectTree` or some other solution. (Of course if the top level node was not left out of the tree on purpose, it could be added to the tree too, but this would make #26325 more of a problem when querying for highlighting of `:InspectTree` - though that is not that important of a problem.)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nInclude information about the top level node in `:InspectTree`.",
