Any and every operation that happens, including buffer changes, happen on the remote server. This makes the editing experience on the local feel \"laggy\" for slow networks. Instead, the editing experience on Neovim should be amazing even when the network is lagging. It's fine if the global search is slow or running system commands is slow, but the editing experience should always be premium and fast.\r\n\r\nI looked into other editors that support such behavior:\r\n1. [JetBrains client](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/remote-development-overview.html#859dd19f): JetBrains Client has an advanced editor based on the JetBrains Riderâ€™s RD protocol, which makes typing feel instant.\r\n2. [Lapce](https://docs.lapce.dev/development/architecture): Lapce lets the client do the buffer management and communicates the delta changes in the buffer over to the server which does everything else.\r\n3. VS Code: My guess, is that VS Code, also does something similar to support snappy editing over remote connections, although I could not find any documents supporting this.\r\n\r\nAnother question is how does this fit into our roadmap and vision for Neovim? If this is something we would be interested in, I would be happy to work towards getting it across the finish line.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEditing is fast even when network is unstable or disconnected (obviously for the cached buffers)",

I am obviously overlooking a lot of actual details and challenges that we would have to get through to make this possible.\r\n\r\nI do not want to distract the group but this approach might have further advantages:\r\n1. Actual real time collaboration can be a reality with this. I don't think it's possible right now. But that's a non-goal for this issue.\r\n2. Right now, UIs are auto adjusted to the smallest viewframe available. Shifting this responsibility onto the client would help each client draw it's own UI and operate at different scales independently with the same data.",
