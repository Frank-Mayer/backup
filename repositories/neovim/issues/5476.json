I currently have the following in my vimrc:\n\n```\n    autocmd BufDelete *\n                \\ if expand('<afile>') =~ '^term://' |\n                \\   let curwin=winnr() |\n                \\   let curtab=tabpagenr() | \n                \\   exe 'noau keepalt tabdo windo try | argd <afile> | catch | endtry' |\n                \\   keepalt noau exe 'normal' curtab.'gt'.curwin.\"\\<c-w>\\<c-w>\" |\n                \\ endif\n```\n\nWhich just deletes terminals from every arglist when they are closed. I don't notice any slowdown, even with very much windows open. Something alike could be put in BufReadCmd, but checking every argument in the arglist for a match would cost more resources of course.\n",
