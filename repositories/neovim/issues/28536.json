That is a readability enhancement and a project standard.\r\n    - The old signature is still supported.\r\n- ~~`lhs` can be a list. This reduces boilerplate when defining aliases for a mapping.~~\r\n\r\n### Comparison\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n    vim.keymap.set('n', 'crr', function()\r\n      vim.lsp.buf.code_action()\r\n    end, { desc = 'vim.lsp.buf.code_action()' })\r\n\r\nAfter (opts is now arg 2 instead of arg 4):\r\n\r\n    vim.keymap.set('n', { desc = 'vim.lsp.buf.code_action()' }, 'crr', function()\r\n      vim.lsp.buf.code_action()\r\n    end)\r\n\r\n",

I think we discussed something similar with the `vim.echo` vs `vim.print` discussion: constistency per language (lua and lua API) is stronger/more important than consistency between vimscript and lua in my opinion. This is of course personal (because we would not be discussing this otherwise), but I'm willing to wager many others feel this way as well. I think you overestimate people's vimscript know-how.",
