    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nThe language server protocol specifies that completion items can contain:\r\n\r\n- snippets\r\n- `additionalTextEdits` (e.g used to add import statements when selecting a completion candidate)\r\n- A `command` (used to execute client side or server side commands - for all sorts of things). For example, vscode defines a `editor.action.triggerParameterHints` client command to trigger a  signature help immediately after a completion candidate got selected.\r\n\r\nCurrently neovim core handles none of that, and instead delegates to completion plugins like nvim-cmp, nvim-lsp-compl or others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nHave this functionality built-in.\r\n\r\nWith https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/25301 the groundwork for snippet expansion is done.\r\nThe next step is to integrate it with the completion, omnifunc. For that we'll need to setup a `CompleteDone` autocmd similar to:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mfussenegger/nvim-lsp-compl/blob/1642f1c57a83a0b630fdf7f339f4a5550a766407/lua/lsp_compl.lua#L565-L668\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen Questions:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Opt-in or opt-out. Enabling it by default could conflict with above established completion plugins. On the other hand, opt-in is another hurdle in getting started from scratch\r\n- [ ] Snippet expansion trigger - implicit/explicit? (For me, always implicit expanding would make this unusable)\r\n\r\n\r\nProposal:\r\n\r\n- Make it opt-in via a `vim.lsp.completion.attach(client, bufnr, [opts])` method that can be called in a `LspAttach` autocmd. It would sets up a `CompleteDone` autocmd for the given buffer and client.\r\n- Add a `vim.lsp.completion.accept()` function that if called causes the next accempted completion candidate to expand a snippet, if the completion item contains one. To be used in a mapping like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvim.keymap.set('i', '<CR>', function()\r\n  return vim.lsp.completion.accept() and '<c-y>' or '<CR>'\r\nend, { expr = true })\r\n```\r\n\r\n`opts` relate a bit to the auto-completion aspect and https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25670, and might not be necessary in a first step.\r\n\r\n## Related issues\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13199\r\n- https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/12310\r\n",
