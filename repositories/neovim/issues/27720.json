Open a file that has more lines than nvim's window height.\r\n3. `G` to go to the bottom.\r\n4. `H` to move the cursor to the top of the window.\r\n5. Run the following code.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal lines = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(0, 0, -1, false)\r\nvim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(0, 0, #lines, true, lines)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\nThe buffer and cursor moves down and lands one line above the bottom `scrolloff`. The exact same behavior as doing `zb` after `step 3.`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nDo not scroll the buffer, and have no visual change in above case.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2504+g3971797be1\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nLinux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWezterm\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\ntmux-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nBuild from source",

I am glad to see that this issue has been caught on your radar.\r\n\r\nI understand that preserving the cursor position while rewriting the buffer content can be challenging. However, I believe it is important to maintain the previous behavior where the cursor position relative to the buffer and window remains the same.\r\n\r\nA common scenario is when reformatting a file, where the entire buffer is replaced with for example stylua's output.\r\n\r\nIt is quite frustrating to have the cursor constantly moving with each format, making the editing experience very unpleasant.\r\n\r\nI have also encountered this issue with UI plugins, such as [nui.nvim](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/nui.nvim/blob/main/lua/nui/tree/README.md), where the cursor jumps when the tree is redrawn inside the buffer, even when the content has not changed.",
