I think this is because they have similar syntax, or possibly because C is the default. That said, `.dsp` files should be detected instead as the `faust` filetype because `.dsp` is the extension used for the Faust programming language.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim should set `filetype=faust` when opening a `.dsp` file. Additionally, Faust uses the `.lib` extension for library files, so it would be nice to have it label those as Faust too. However, I'm not sure if any other languages use `.lib` as an extension too, so it's possible that will have to be excluded if there are conflicts. Right now, `.lib` detected as C too, so I don't _think_ there are any conflicts.",
