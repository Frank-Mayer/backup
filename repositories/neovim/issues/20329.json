Let's say we have this block of text:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntext1\r\ntext2\r\ntext3\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the top left, I press <kbd>Control-V</kbd> to enter visual block mode. I go down twice and then press <kbd>Shift-I</kbd>. At this point I should be able to see three cursors in front of each line. As I type some text, I should be seeing the text on all of the lines, not just the top one. This should definitely be the default behavior, just like `incsearch`.",

And, when leaving insert mode, the text for the other affected locations is computed and inserted.\n\nThis differs from `:s`, where the changes are made only when the command is submitted. So, the changes made by the preview function can be discarded.\n\nSo, what would be the preferred approach in this case? I can think of:\n\n- keep inserting the visual block text while leaving insert mode. Add a preview while typing. \n    - would this imply that the real time regular insert mode text would also be a preview and would also need to be inserted later? \n- update the visual block text in real time\n    - the text should be computed early\n    - i think this should be handled as a special case in the functions that handle insert mode changes\n    - the code for inserting the visual block text while leaving insert mode should be removed\n- some other approach (?\n\nAlso, is the code diverging from its Vim counterpart a concern?",
