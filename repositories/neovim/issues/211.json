It would also require a bit of support from the UI, since it's required to display the virtual cursors.\n\nAt least for initially, it appears that this could be implemented without any modification to the code source code.\n",

It also requires multiple buffers, like when you copy using (i.e.) six carets and then pastes accordingly in the six current positions.\n\nThis also means every caret can have it's own selection and context, so the solution of \"virtual carets\" is unfeasible because when (for example) a plugin relies on a caret-position-change-event it will break thanks to the wrongly assumption that the event did indeed happen.\n\n---\n\nOne advantage of supporting this out of the box is that plugins can be made with this feature in mind, for example plugins that write a sequence of numbers in every caret (first caret: 0, second caret: 1, etc).\n\n@tarruda I'm one of the people that will not use neovim if this is not supported out of the box, I might be a minority but just so you know we actually exist.\n",

It would be extremely difficult integrating such a feature in the current code.\n\nI'm not saying it will take years for this feature to be available in neovim, as I mentioned in my previous comments I even have a few ideas on how this may be implemented as a \"new-style\" plugin(with proper support from the UIs), which would be a lot less error-prone than messing with a very obscure part of the C code.\n\nAfter my goals for the first iteration are achieved I might even take such task for myself. If the majority of the community feels this is a necessary feature, it will probably be bundled with the official distributions of neovim.\n\nPersonally, I don't see any productivity gain by using multiple cursors over plain old vim macros. It's probably more beginner-friendly though and certainly has the \"eye candy effect\".\n",

The thing is that you usually don't do that, the amount of mental effort and keypresses needed when working with multiple cursors is so low that it takes over a lot of macro functionality at lower cost. What you're talking about is exactly the sort of use-case where macro's are nicer. Multicursors are so friction free to use that if there were 2 or 3 occurrences in the project where I had to do such an operation, I would just repeat the keystrokes with multiple cursors. Not DRY, but very easy and quite fast. \n\nTo give an estimate:\n\nFor 95% of all usecases where both **multiple cursors** and **macro's** can be used, **multiple cursors** are easier and more intuitive for 95% of all users. For all usecases where only **macro's** can be used, **macro's** are better (naturally...).\n\nMacro's may subsume multiple cursors, but that doesn't mean multiple cursors wouldn't be nice ;)\n",

            "body": "@tarruda @moljac024 One more thing about multiple cursors not yet reviewed in here but critically important, for example you have some chunk of code and you seek for some literal there and you start by CTRL-N (for example) and seek next occurence of the word and place the additional caret on its start (or better where you cursor in prev word was positioned) and then suddenly you decide to skip several occurences and then continue checking the others. THats the point of all the multicursors besides the things that were already discussed earlier, and this kinda things are absolutely hard to implement with macros on the fly. I dont also get into the account some hard regexp selections that are concerned to exist for detecting some complex multiple cursor behaviour.\n",

Macros are great and useful but MCs are better in a lot of situations. The thing to remember is that it's not just a fancy search and replace; it's all about using vim motions. That's what truly made the Sublime implementation so amazing; the fact that you could use them with Vintage mode. That is also why the current vim implementations of MCs aren't good; you can't really use proper motions like diw. Although I get by with the current MC implementation, it's really clunky.\n",

Part of what makes Sublime successful in that regard is that it forced developers to have to be multi-caret-aware as well as having a vim emulation that handles MCs fairly well. While I admit I'm completely ignorant as to how vim works, it still seems to me like it would ultimately be a better alternative to do it natively. That way, if neovim would be binded to sublime or even limetext, at least neovim would be multi-caret-aware and integrate better with those editors.\n\nFor me, neovim's true potentially is the ability to allow other editors to bind it and not have to worry about supporting all the vim features. From an opportunity costs stand point, this is going to be huge for the development community accross all languages/editors. Think about it... how many text editors out there have vi emulation layers? How many hours of programming have been spent on something neovim can easily solve? If neovim could have MC support, then more editors will have no issues replacing their emulation layer.\n",

On the contrary, Multiple Cursors are an interactive and adaptable process, the user can see what is happening as they make changes and can adopt on the fly to strange situations. I believe that from a usability perspective this is just plain better, and more user-friendly, let's not blind ourselves with vim elitism and pretend that macros are always a cinch to use. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: \nAs @aktau said:\n\n> To give an estimate:\n> \n> For 95% of all usecases where both multiple cursors and macro's can be used, multiple cursors are\n> easier and more intuitive for 95% of all users. For all usecases where only macro's can be used, \n> macro's are better (naturally...).\n\nUnderstandably there are MASSIVE code changes associated with implementing this, which I believe would put a pretty hefty stall on normal Neovim development, so I agree that this should be left until after initial release (though perhaps a small team could be dedicated to start working on it shortly after that).\nThere'll be more than a few cases where multiple cursors will seriously screw things up, but we can work through that as a community, let's grow this editor together!\n",
