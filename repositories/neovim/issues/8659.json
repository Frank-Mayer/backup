    "body": "- `nvim --version`: v0.3.0\r\n- Vim (version: ) behaves differently? N/A\r\n- Operating system/version: Ubuntu 18.04\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\nI wrote some lua test code to verify that `nvim_buf_set_lines()` will work with a buffer that has been `:bunload`'ed. It doesn't :-( I experienced two incorrect behaviours:\r\n\r\n1. A line range such as `0, -1` is always constrained to `0, 1` because internally `normalize_index()` thinks there is only 1 line in the buffer. Attempting to replace all lines in the file will only replace the first line.\r\n2. You should be able to use a single `:undo` to revert the changes from `nvim_buf_set_lines()`, however if the buffer was unloaded then the undo information gets mangled and using :undo puts the buffer in weird states that it never even transitioned through.\r\n\r\nYou can paste the test code into e.g. `test/functional/api/buffer_spec.lua` to flag both bugs:\r\n\r\n    it('set_lines works correctly for unloaded buffers', function()\r\n      -- we'll need to know our bufnr for when it gets unloaded\r\n      local bufnr = buffer('get_number', 0)\r\n      -- replace the buffer contents with these two lines\r\n      buffer('set_lines', bufnr, 0, -1, 1, {'line1', 'line2', 'line3'})\r\n      -- confirm that getting lines works\r\n      eq({'line2', 'line3'}, buffer('get_lines', bufnr, 1, 3, 1))\r\n      -- save the file then unload it\r\n      command('file some-test-file.txt')\r\n      command('write')\r\n      command('new')\r\n      command('bunload '..bufnr)\r\n      -- attempting to get lines now gives empty list\r\n      eq({}, buffer('get_lines', bufnr, 1, 3, 1))\r\n      -- use nvim_buf_set_lines() to override the entire file contents\r\n      buffer('set_lines', bufnr, 0, -1, 1, {'LINE A', 'LINE B'})\r\n      -- open the buffer again\r\n      command('sbuf '..bufnr)\r\n      -- entire file contents should have been replaced\r\n      eq({'LINE A', 'LINE B'}, buffer('get_lines', bufnr, 0, -1, 1)) -- THIS FAILS\r\n      -- undo should put everything back how it was\r\n      command('undo')\r\n      eq({'line1', 'line2', 'line3'}, buffer('get_lines', bufnr, 0, -1, 1)) -- THIS ALSO FAILS\r\n    end)\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nThe test code fails at the lines mentioned.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nThe test should pass - i.e. `nvim_buf_set_lines()` always works correctly with unloaded buffers. Or possibly `nvim_buf_set_lines()` could just raise an error if the buffer isn't loaded.",

That is, unloading a buffer loses its in-memory undo info, by design.",
