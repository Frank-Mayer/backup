Thus, we cannot invoke gotoDefinition/Declaration/Implementation on anything.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAfter opening a popup window (e.g.: with a hover message) and adding the window to the LSP server, we could invoke some LSP functions, mostly goto.... functions. It would make sense to disable diagnostics. This would make transitioning between files much easier and improve better control flow following when debugging or when a programmer is getting used to an API.\r\n\r\nThis sparks a question of whether it would be possible to create a range-based enabled region for some of the LSP functions. This would be helpful in helpers e.g.: also goto..... methods",
