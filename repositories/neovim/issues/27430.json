A line with just `>` disappears when I try to join it with other lines using `J`. This _seems_ to only happen if the other line has `%` in it and if the filetype is set to anything else but `html`.\r\n\r\nFrom my testing, this happens only with `>` and `%`. I tested with regular Vim and things are working fine there. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/23367882/3893a4b9-97a2-4ee0-8b39-c0fd0a98b28b\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. nvim --clean\r\n2. Write `%` in one line and `>` in the next line\r\n3. On the line with `%`, press `J` to join the next line\r\n4. Observe that the `>` has completely disappeared.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAfter pressing `J`, the two lines should be combined to form `% >`\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.5\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim works as expected\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 13.4.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm 3.4.23\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nHomebrew",
