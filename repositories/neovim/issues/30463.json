Currently, one has to manually revert any debugging changes made in each region once the problem is determined to be somewhere else.\r\n\r\nI realize this is \"out there\" but I find myself missing this feature frequently enough to at least ask.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nHaving some variant of `u` and/or `U` which would apply only to the currently selected region. The key binding is the least of the problem here. Undo would be linear (reverse order of changes) for all operations that affected the region. For operations that also had impact outside the region, it is a question whether to include them or not; I tend towards \"yes\" but that might need to be configured or controlled somehow.",
