With `:set filetype=json` I even get syntax highlighting while at the same time making it very easy to work with the output (neovim is amazing!). \r\n\r\nNow I would like to fold the output of each run so I can easily find, distinguish and jump between them.\r\n\r\nWith `:set foldmethod=marker` and the default marker `{{{,}}}` something like:\r\n\r\n    find . | entr -c sh -c 'date | tr \"\\n\" \" \"; echo {{{; python3 sun.py | json_pp; echo }}}'\r\n\r\nSame output as before but wrapped in a fold with the current date and time as a label. I have tested it in a regular buffer and there it works as expected.\r\n\r\nAnother use case: If you add the marker to your shell's prompt you could even collapse the output of every single command. \r\n\r\nOr you could change the foldmarker to `{,}` and fold json directly.",

I have tested it for a few hours and it really does work great (even works in ncurses apps like ranger/ncmpcpp). \r\n\r\nThe only issue is that clearing the screen with `ctrl-l`/`clear` does not always properly remove all scrollback which might lead to an open fold hiding your prompt. This can be fixed by entering a comment to close the fold (like `#}}}`), optionally disabling folding first to see what you're typing.\r\n\r\nThat seems to be an issue with the way zsh \"clears\" the screen though, neovim does interpret everything correctly. \r\n\r\nAnd I see that terminal buffer might be modifiable in the future which would fix this as well. It would also allow for creating marker folds after the command has run. Exciting üëç ",
