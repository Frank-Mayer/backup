    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nRegular expressions can use the `\\<` and `\\>` atoms to match the position at the start or end of a word (using the iskeyword definition), but there is no atom to match at the start or end of a WORD (whitespace-delimited).\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would like to request new regex atoms that match at the beginning and end of a whitespace-delimited WORD. The atoms should be zero-width, just like `\\<` and `\\>`.\r\n\r\nI'm not partial to what the atoms are, but for the sake of describing the feature, let's call them `\\_<` and `\\_>`.\r\n\r\nThen, let's use this file for an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Example {\r\n    static final String BOOK = \"The Republic\";\r\n    static final String pub_sub_url = \"http://non-public.server.io\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe desired behavior is that I can search with the regex `\\_<pub` and I should see two matches: the \"pub\" at the beginning of \"**pub**lic\" and the \"pub\" at the beginning of \"**pub**_sub_url\", because in each case the match is at a WORD boundary. The \"pub\" in the middle of \"Re**pub**lic\" and the \"pub\" in \"non-**pub**lic.server\" should not match, because there is no WORD boundary.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for `\\_>`, it should match only at the *end* of a WORD.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\nWithout dedicated atoms for WORD boundaries, it's possible to achieve this behavior in one of three ways:\r\n\r\n1. Accurate emulation of the atoms\r\n\r\n`\\S\\@<!\\S\\@=` matches at the start of a WORD boundary, and `\\s\\@<!\\S\\@!` matches at the end. They behave similarly to how `\\<` and `\\>` behave, but for WORDs. This is the behavior I would like, but it's quite clunky and hard to remember, for something that is a common and straightforward scenario.\r\n\r\n2. Less accurate emulation\r\n\r\n`\\S\\@<!` for start of WORD and `\\S\\@!` for end of WORD work well as part of a larger pattern, but give incorrect results when used alone. They are easier to remember but still fairly clunky.\r\n\r\n3. Changing `iskeyword`\r\n\r\nSetting the `iskeyword` option to the value `!-~` changes `\\<` and `\\>` to have the desired behavior. This too is clunky, and needs to be reset afterwards, and cannot be combined in the same pattern with the word-boundary atoms (since it effectively overwrites those atoms with a new definition).\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nA detailed discussion of the problem and the existing workarounds are [here](https://stackoverflow.com/q/55522385/2562319) on StackOverflow. I think the workarounds are clunky and that a new dedicated atom for this use case would be a better solution.\r\n\r\nI use both NeoVim and vim, and I filed this feature request for both. The corresponding request for vim is [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/14164).",
