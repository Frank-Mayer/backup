Also, there weren't any mappings that showed any description before (`:nmap gx` or `telescope.builtin.keymaps`).\r\n\r\n`nowait` is a good solution, but I deleted it by:\r\n```lua\r\nvim.keymap.del({ \"n\", \"x\" }, \"gx\")\r\n```\r\nbecause it deletes the description along the way\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply!",
