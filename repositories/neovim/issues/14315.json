    "body": "Hello. Perhaps this is already planned, but I couldn't find it. Obviously feel free to close if it the request exists.\r\n\r\nWe have `vim.api.nvim_open_win`, but it only supports opening floating windows.\r\n\r\nIt'd be nice to have a way to create normal windows from Lua. In particular, this code I wrote (or really cargo culted) to do so with command mode is slightly clunky to me:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n  vim.cmd \"vsplit\"\r\n  vim.cmd(string.format(\"buffer %d\", bufnr))\r\n\r\n  local winnr = vim.api.nvim_win_get_number(0)\r\n\r\n  for name, value in pairs(_DEFAULT_WIN_OPTIONS) do\r\n    vim.api.nvim_win_set_option(winnr, name, value)\r\n  end\r\n  vim.api.nvim_set_current_win(current_window)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt'd instead be nice to have either a new function `nvim_create_win` (or `nvim_split_win`, doesn't matter much) or an extension of `nvim_open_win` for non-floating windows which looked like:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.api.nvim_create_win(\r\n    bufnr_to_put_in_the_window_or_0_to_use_the_current_buffer,\r\n    opts = {\r\n        vertical = true,\r\n        window_opts = {\r\n            'filename' = 'foobar',\r\n            'wrap' = false,\r\n            'textwidth' = 37,\r\n        }   \r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nand which returns the `winnr` (as `nvim_buf_create` returns the `bufnr`).",

(And closing the window first causes a segfault). I guess I'm asking for some advice of how to properly get a split to open with the floating window handle that properly transfers the relevant window info. (And maybe some pointers about the stuff in `window.c`.)\r\n\r\nI can push my current work as a draft pr if you'd like more info!",
