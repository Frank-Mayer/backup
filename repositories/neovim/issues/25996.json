    "body": "### Problem\n\nThere is currently no way to set the width at which text is wrapped when `'wrap'` is set: the text is wrapped when it hits the edge of the window, which can be impractical when dealing with wide windows.\r\nWrapping at a given column can be achieved by setting `'textwidth'`, but this is not always desirable/possible: there might be rules or convention in place for a document, and it makes edits much more annoying and noisy, especially when version control is involved.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd like to introduce a new option (name to be determined) or just re-purpose `'textwidth'` when `'wrap'` is enabled to allow soft-wrapping text at a given column/width.\r\nIf this feature is deemed acceptable, I'm happy to give implementing it a shot, but I'd appreciate some pointers on how to best implement it.\r\n\r\nThe behavior when the window is narrower than the wrapping width remains to be determined: I suggest not wrapping any trailing characters, as if `'wrap'` was disabled, but we could also wrap them like e.g. Neomutt does. The behavior could also be configurable (which would require more discussion of the name of the options to be introduced/repurposed, but this is just bikeshedding).\r\n\r\nI don't know of other text editors that implement a similar feature, but Neomutt's  pager does something very similar via its `wrap` and `reflow_wrap` configuration variables.",
