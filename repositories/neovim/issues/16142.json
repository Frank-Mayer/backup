If it shouldn’t then neither should be original vim  completion functionality. Which is maybe fine, but no one seems to mention that. What’s your opinion on that?",

I don’t see anything wrong with clearly defining what should be in the core and what should be implemented in plugins. For example core can only have editing operations, window management, vim bindings and language, vimscript. Something like that.",

As-you-type is _autocompletion_ (as opposed to mere \"completion\"). We want to have strong primitives for building autocomplete solutions:\r\n    - Function that decides _when to trigger autocomplete_ (based on buffer text + cursor position)\r\n    - Anything else...?\r\n2. \"fuzzy\" matching / completion:\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/13854\r\n    - https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12995\r\n3. cmdline (command line) mode\r\n    - CursorMovedC was added in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/29436\r\n\r\n---\r\n_Locked to keep the summary visible.
