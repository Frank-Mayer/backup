            "body": "> This only happens with treesitter because treesitter uses `nvim__redraw`. Related: [#28668](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/28668)\n\nUnrelated but I found that it still happens even after `vim.treesitter.stop()`. This is because `stop()` does not actually stop the highlighter's `on_bytes` callback.\n\nThe issue also happens when calling anything else that flushes the cursor position at msg_row/col still at the end of the newly changed cmdline. I.e. the following reproduces the flickering also without treesitter enabled:\n```lua\nlocal function replace_first_line_preview(opts, preview_ns, preview_buf)\n  local replacement = opts.args\n  vim.api.nvim_buf_set_text(0, 0, 0, 1, -1, { replacement })\n  vim.cmd.sleep(\"1m\")\n  -- vim.cmd.redrawtabline()\n  return 2\nend\n\nvim.treesitter.stop()\nvim.api.nvim_create_user_command(\n  \"ReplaceFirstLine\",\n  function() end,\n  { nargs = 1, preview = replace_first_line_preview }\n)\n```\n\nUnlikely that any of those commands make sense to call inside the cmdpreview callback but I think it does indicate that a proper solution would be to ensure that the cursor is at the correct position before doing cmdpreview: #31040.\n\n> Hmm, there is a difference between different options of nvim__redraw regarding how the redraw can be reflected immediately:\n\nTrue, do you think that presents a problem intrinsically? Currently `nvim__redraw` tries to not bother the caller with this and do what's needed implicitly.\n\n> For cursor, statuscolumn, statusline and winbar, only a ui_flush() is needed to reflect the redraw immediately.\n\nTrue except for statuscolumn which does require `update_screen()`.\n\n> For range, both update_screen() and ui_flush() are needed to reflect the redraw immediately, so calling ui_flush() without update_screen() won't work (and leads to the flicker here).\n\nYeah `nvim__redraw->range()` currently does more than what the old `nvim__buf_redraw_range()` did, and that the `ui_flush()` doesn't actually reflect what's intended to be redrawn for the TS `changedtree` callback (updated highlights). I raised this previously in the original PR:https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28101#issuecomment-209105796 (without response). Currently it basically serves as a \"flush pressed keys because TS callback may take a long time\" (unintended). \n\nWe can either keep the `ui_flush()` for `range` (which was established to have improved editor responsiveness when added to the TS highlighter path), in which case it should probably also `update_screen()` (one doesn't make sense without the other as you say although I don't think it's what leads to the flicker per se).\n\nOr we can special case `range` and omit it the `ui_flush()` to keep it working like in 0.9 if there is a valid reason for doing so.\n\n**Further findings:**\n\nOn top of the `on_bytes` callback still being active after `vim.treesitter.stop()`, it seems entirely redundant in the first place? AFAIU an `on_bytes` callback should mean that the buffer range is already marked for redraw by `change.c`. Removing the callback altogether seems to confirm that, which doesn't yield any failed tests. I raised #31041 to do away with it. \n\nSo I think calling `update_screen()` and `ui_flush()` implicitly for `range` would make sense: #31042. But only if we get rid of the `on_bytes` callback as there it would just yield double redraws since the usual pattern is `extmark_splice` (emits `on_bytes`) -> `changed_()` marking the buffer to be redrawn again.\n\n\n",
