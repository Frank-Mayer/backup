    "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\nAn omode mapping is errantly used when playing a macro\r\n\r\n**vim**\r\nI also filed the following as a [vim issue](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/6350) as well since it was suggested on IRC to file in both places. I can reproduce this on nvim 0.4.3 and v0.5.0-439-gfb4c7a53c.\r\n\r\nThe issue is the same except the (incorrect) text that's inserted differs slightly between the two.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Create a vimrc:\r\n```\r\nfunction! MyFunc()\r\n    echom \"hi from func\"\r\nendfunction\r\n\r\nonoremap , :<c-u>call MyFunc()<CR>\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run vim with `vim -u <rcfile from above>` and in the new buffer and type: `foo([blah])`\r\n3. In normal mode, starting on `f`, record a macro: `ct[,bar<Esc>`\r\n4. Undo that change and then play the macro on the text in step 2 above. When **playing** the macro I instead see a result of:\r\n```\r\ncall MyFunc()\r\nblah[blah])\r\n```\r\n(vim results in `:<c-u>call MyFunc()<CR>bar[blah])`)\r\n\r\nI expect vim to be in insert mode when it processes the `,` in the macro, but it seems that character is being interpreted in the context of operator pending mode.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expect the playing the macro to result in `,bar[blah])`. In fact, this is what happens when **recording** the macro.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n  - neovim versiom: 0.4.3 and v0.5.0-439-gfb4c7a53c.\r\n  - OS: macOS 10.15, CentOS 6.6\r\n  - Terminal: iTerm2\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIf I `:ounmap ,`, the macro plays as expected.",

For example: >\r\n\tfunc StoreColumn()\r\n\t  let g:column = col('.')\r\n\t  return 'x'\r\n\tendfunc\r\n\tnnoremap <expr> x StoreColumn()\r\n\tnmap ! f!x\r\nYou will notice that g:column has the value from before executing \"f!\",\r\nbecause \"x\" is evaluated before \"f!\" is executed.\r\nThis can be solved by inserting <Ignore> before the character that is\r\nexpression-mapped: >\r\n\tnmap ! f!<Ignore>x\r\n```\r\nBut that workaround doesn't work in this case.",
