It's good to know that you can relate to my concerns and that things are headed in the right direction.\r\n\r\n> I agree in general, but I think you are overstating the case. There are some holes, which get patched up. But also going forward, both Vim and Nvim are tending to increase \"visibility\" in the form of :checkhealth and programmatic mechanisms such as mapset(), which increase trust and reduce anxiety. \r\n\r\nAutomated mechanisms like :checkhealth are great but they are not designed to catch user \"ignorance\" (for lack of a better term). For example,  `'ignorecase'` being on is not necessarily an error that should be flagged by the automated mechanism. But if a user has it on and is ignorant about some affect that it has, that's still a problem. This is a situation that needs to be resolved in the user's mind, not somewhere else.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally, I stumbled upon another thing today that `'ignorecase'` affects: **expressions**.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n- With `'ignorecase'` off: 'abc' == 'ABC' evaluates to 0\r\n- With `'ignorecase'` on: 'abc' == 'ABC' evaluates to 1\r\n\r\nPerhaps the real problem is that some options are overloaded? May be it would have been better to have more options and have options grouped into categories, e.g.,\r\n- `'search.ignorecase'` (all options that have to do with search would start with `search.`)\r\n- `'cmd_completion.ignorecase'`\r\n- `'ins_completion.ignorecase'`\r\n- `'expression.ignorecase'`\r\n \r\nThis kind of grouping of options would help remove overloading and also provide a sort of self-documentation. Of course, there are downsides to this as well, e.g., verbosity.",
