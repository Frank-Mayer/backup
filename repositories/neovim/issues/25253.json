Denormalizing everything in every place isn't maintainable.\r\n\r\nThat's not what I'm suggesting.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that _neither_ `:h 'smartcase'` _nor_ `:h 'ignorecase'` mention that that they affect **commandline completion** or **insert mode completion**.\r\n\r\nFor example, with `ignorecase` on:\r\n`:dir<Tab>` on the commandline will complete to `:Dirvish`. This is not the case with `ignorecase` off.\r\n\r\nI discovered this by chance; there is no place in the help docs that mention this.\r\n\r\nI think this is a microcosm of a larger problem in the help docs for options: if users can't trust the docs to tell them what an option affects comprehensively, then an underlying anxiety builds up within them about how they are affecting their system. \r\n\r\n(Regarding de-duplication/normalization of information, I am a fan. Duplication is absolutely terrible for maintenance. Information gets quickly out of sync. As much as possible, information should be in one place and one place only and linked to where needed)",
