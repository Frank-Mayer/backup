So the question is whether you expect somebody running Vim “in a batch mode” without `-u NONE` from system() (possible in some plugins) and whether you expect to run terminal emulator from `:!` or `system()` and run Vim there. If you do then these should be taken out. If not, better keep them. Then also needed to take into account if there are some scripts which expect to be run from `:!` / `system()` / `jobstart()` and see environment variable there.\r\n\r\nActually I would say that Vim is right in doing so because it does not and should not expect these variables to be used not from Vim. We would be also right if we were using `NVIM` and `NVIMRUNTIME`, but we chose not to and are now facing various problems.\r\n\r\nThough “right thing to do” (but highly incompatible) here in my opinion is removing use of $VIM, $VIMRUNTIME, $MYVIMRC in editor and replacing that with `v:` variables: this way you are not special-casing any environment variables read access: i.e. `echo $VIM` will not make new environment variable suddenly emerge from the void as well as there will be no situation where `:echo $VIM` shows one thing and `:!echo $VIM` another.",
