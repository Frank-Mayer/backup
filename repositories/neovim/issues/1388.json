This means 3rd-party's downloads will not be cached which is painful especially for repeating compiling for debug purpose.\n\n[Homebrew's policy](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Acceptable-Formulae.md#we-dont-like-install-scripts-that-download-things) is let homebrew handle external resource's download. An example is [here](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/ansible.rb).\n\nIt would increase developer's job a little. But compare to its advantage, it's worthy to do it.\n",

Let neovim use bundled dependencies but let homebrew download the sources for it(using `resources`). As it's bundled, neovim should be more stable than approach 1.
