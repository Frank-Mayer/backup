That's it! Neovim implicitly takes care of the problem. You may have to restart neovim (`nvim`).\n\n**Reasons:**  As taken from `:help clipboard` run from neovim commandline\n\n> Nvim has no direct connection to the system clipboard. Instead it is\n> accessible through a |provider| which transparently uses shell commands for\n> communicating with the clipboard.\n> \n> Clipboard access is implicitly enabled if any of the following clipboard tools\n> are found in your `$PATH`.\n> - xclip\n> - xsel (newer alternative to xclip)\n> - pbcopy/pbpaste (Mac OS X)\n> - lemonade (for SSH) https://github.com/pocke/lemonade\n> - doitclient (for SSH) http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/doit/\n\nAs on 5 October, 2016 on Ubuntu 16.04LTS, neovim installed via ppa.\n",
