These are typically very old, but since users only see a release number and SHA1, it is not obvious how old the software actually is.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nInclude a build timestamp (or even just a date) in the version information.\r\n\r\nCurrent:\r\n```\r\n❯ nvim --version\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1896+g91f57723a-Homebrew\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1700008891\r\n\r\n   system vimrc file: \"$VIM/sysinit.vim\"\r\n  fall-back for $VIM: \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/neovim/HEAD-91f5772/share/nvim\"\r\n\r\nRun :checkhealth for more info\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected:\r\n```\r\n❯ nvim --version\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1896+g91f57723a-Homebrew\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nBuild time: 2023-12-06T17:59:17Z\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1700008891\r\n\r\n   system vimrc file: \"$VIM/sysinit.vim\"\r\n  fall-back for $VIM: \"/opt/homebrew/Cellar/neovim/HEAD-91f5772/share/nvim\"\r\n\r\nRun :checkhealth for more info\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin nvim, the `:version` command should also include the build timestamp",
