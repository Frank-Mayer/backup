    "body": "On of the goals of neovim project is the modernization of the build system. The chosen cmake makes it easy to generate project files and configurations for different systems and tool chains. But instead of normalizing the handling of the build system, we introduce the following hierarchy:\n- **make** - which cannot be replaced by Ninja or other tools, to many cleanups\n  - **other Makefiles** - \n  - **cmake** - should be on the top, changing config required Makefile modification\n  - **handcrafted scripts** - which parse some stuff and do things and a serial and non-abstract way, lot of redundant code\n    - **build systems of 3rd-party libs**\n  - **tests** - called in a serial way, handcrafted, output not parsable, Makefile driven but contains a lot of shell script stuff\n\nInstead of improving it, we introduced a lot of new scripts and more jumping-around stuff the last days. I recommend improving the situation using the following strategy:\n1. replace top-level Makefile by cmake code (even when it's only some-script calls)\n2. decouple tests/build/config\n3. move scripts into cmake and replace many calls by cmake-directives\n4. port over test to CTest\n",

I completely disagree with using CMake or C to write tests. Scripting languages are much simpler to use and luajit's ffi module let us talk with C code almost transparently. I've just pushed an [example](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/unit/misc1.moon) and will soon write documentation that will help contributors write their own tests.\n\nMoonscript will probably be used for writing functional tests when the msgpack UI is ready\n",

Here's the feature list from CMake's site:\n- Run all or sub-sets of tests for a project\n- Submit testing results to Dart 1,2 and CDash\n- Run tests that build and run --build-and-test command\n- support coverage with gcc, and bullseye coverage tools\n- support memory checking with valgrind, purify, and bounds checker\n\nI think one really nice feature is that it doesn't care about what language was used.  It simply needs to be executable, and return a non-zero exit code on error, and 0 on success.  So you could have tests that require C (for some reason), some written in shell (like the current test driver for Vim's tests), or something else.  I'm pretty sure `busted` only does Lua based tests, so you kind of miss out on the other stuff.  That said, there's nothing to stop us from driving the unit tests with `busted` and tying everything together with CTest.\n\nMy only real concern in bringing it up was that I wanted to break the misconception that CTest somehow requires C.  It does not.\n",

As dependencies pop up, developers want to be able to add them when they need them, and so it means others needs to modify the build as well.  That's where the pain comes in. :-(\n\nI'm not saying CMake is perfect--it is not, and I've not met any build tool that is.  CMake has certainly got its share of issues--many of which I agree with you on.  But, as a developer, CMake is far easier to wrap my head around.  And, it allows me to use tools--like Ninja--who have much better build times than make.\n\nIn the end it's about a trade-off: more pain on the packaging front, or more pain on the development front.  NeoVim is not the first project to use CMake, so I feel it's best to optimize for the latter (sorry!).  And at the end of the day, you have to use either tool smartly.  Perhaps you can help us to make your life easier by making sure we do that with CMake.\n",

But seconds count and Ninja saves them.  Plus, developers don't need to know to pass `-j N` to make to get a speedier build.  The difference with using Ninja is at least ten-fold on a Windows box--starting a process on Windows is much longer than on Linux box, make starts many of them.\n\nSorry, I'm just not convinced that we should have developers suffer that penalty to make packaging easier for Linux.  What about packaging on Windows?  What about packaging on the Mac--an actual DMG file that users can use to install, not Homebrew?  CMake helps on all those fronts, autotools does not.\n\n> neovim has probably 5 deps in total all of them using pkgconf, making that part a single standard line to add one of them.\n\nDependencies are only half the story.  What about building on Windows with the MSVC toolchain?  There's no hope of doing that without mingw/msys/cygwin, which just slows down the build more.  Again, building for Linux is not the only consideration.  It may appear that way now because the project is bootstrapping itself, but it's not going to stay that way.\n\n> As said, I can prepare an autotools-based build system quickly and make it clean enough so you can see if it would be a pain.\n> \n> I'm sure cmake is a pain to me since my problems are in the core cmake, not the fact somebody got wrong how to use it.\n\nThen why not try to address those issues with the CMake team?\n",

Especially with ccache, hopefully it stays that way.\n\nAs for the issue at hand: I don't really have any problem with cmake, but I don't plan on developing the build system, just use it. I usually use plain make and pkg-config, but that's not very portable to windows (msvc at least) so that won't work in the case of vim. I mean, we're dropping a lot of platforms but definitely not the big 4 (win, linux, osx, freebsd).\n\nI do have one input of an example that's possible to follow (though I don't recommend it):\n\n[nanomsg](https://github.com/nanomsg/nanomsg) has both a cmake and autoconf-based build system. It started out with a very simple and clean cmake-based one, which I quite liked. But I believe someone (probably a distro maintainer) convinced them that autoconf was way better for unices and offered to do the build system. So now they have both systems, because they don't want to drop msvc support, which is understandable. This does mean maintaining a double system and changing the build system a bit becomes a whole ordeal.\n",
