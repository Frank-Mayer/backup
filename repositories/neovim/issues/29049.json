One could:\r\n* Download commit-specific tarballs like https://github.com/libuv/libuv/archive/541329d51f82bce83bd81ff7640edabfc32d149c.tar.gz + checking its SHA256: same issue as before as tarballs are volatile\r\n* Download commit-specific tarballs without explicit SHA256-check: clear loss of security\r\n* Clone with git and checking out a specific commit hash: Will be stable and should work fine, but a bit more complex as e.g. git is needed, cloning is perhaps slower than a single download, etc. Also git uses SHA-1 which is broken wrt. security, but I'm not too deep into that topic myself either.\r\n\r\n> To me this seems like this attack might just as likely occur when git cloning a repo.\r\n\r\nThere is a small but significant difference between manually cloning a repo from an url and having a build process download dependencies behind the scenes:\r\n* When you manually clone a repo by typing a command like `git clone https://abc`, you explicitly express that at this point in time you trust the URL `https://abc` and your network configuration.\r\n* When you build a package like neovim, which you might have obtained e.g. as a tarball and saved locally before, you don't necessarily have inspected every line of code of that tarball for possible downloads and checked that you trust every URL and the way they are downloaded. Instead, you trust neovim to only download what is already known and trusted by it.\r\n\r\nThis is why the SHA256-checks (as they are already implemented) are critical to have.\r\n\r\n> Are there any other FOSS projects (except maybe nix?) that is prepared for the complete collapse of society? Is this a problem most projects have attempted to solve, and if so, how have they achieved it?\r\n\r\nI think this is a twofold question.\r\n\r\nAbout the concrete case of GitHub-generated tarballs I would say most projects using them have not solved it at all. You can google something like \"github tarball sha256\" and will find many cases where this became an unexpected issue.\r\n\r\nHowever, normally it is solved upstream by projects providing immutable tarballs per version, either built manually or in CI. As a concrete example, here are the source and binary downloads for current OpenBSD, along with the SHA256 hashes, which are also signed: https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/7.5/arm64/ They will never change, you can mirror them yourself and 10 years from now, even if the internet collapsed, you can still upgrade OpenBSD 7.4 to 7.5 securely without skipping any signature checks (unless the public key expired of course)\r\n\r\nIn our case unfortunately many of those projects used don't provide tarballs, like the tree-sitter parsers for example. But I see it is planned to move generated files to github releases eventually so perhaps this is already the solution for those: https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/930 (\"CLI commands - Add new pack and publish subcommands to the Tree-sitter CLI, for uploading tarballs and compiled .wasm files to the GitHub releases API.\")\r\nOther projects actually do provide stable tarballs like libuv: https://dist.libuv.org/dist/v1.48.0/ \r\n\r\nSo maybe the solution here is to simply replace the URLs where a stable tarball is available with that, and wait for tree-sitter to publish the parsers in github releases.",
