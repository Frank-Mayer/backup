    "body": "### Problem\n\nUsing a macro which has any kind of searching simply does not work with neovim. Calling the macro manually (@q) yields the correct result - find next instance and delete, but pressing dot repeat on the same macro after that deletes in place instead of moving. It's extremely frustrating.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nTo reproduce it have a file which you need to search through to make modifications, I needed to delete <th> elements from html file whose classes started with 0R so I did the following:\r\n> gg\r\n> qq\r\n> /0R\r\n> d2j\r\n> q\r\n> @q (goes to next iteration of th and removes it)\r\n> . (does not move, instead deleted 3 lines in place)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nDot repeat needs to have the same result as @q\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.2-dev-49+ga3f9bd7f7\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo, vim executes the dotrepeat on macros perfectly, I ended up editing the file in Vim\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 24.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nfoot version: 1.16.2 +pgo +ime +graphemes -assertions\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nfoot\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",
