    "body": "### Problem\n\nThis issue is similar to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25365, but for the `alternate-file`.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that when deleting a buffer (with `:bd`), say `file1`, that buffer is just unlisted and \"invisibly\" stays the `alternate-file` for another buffer `file2`. When `file2` is active, pressing `Ctrl-^` will make neovim attempt to re-open `file1`.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- some buffers can't be reloaded\r\n- typically, a buffer was deleted for a reason, so it's unlikely that someone would use the `Ctrl-^` command with the intention to reload that buffer (although in certain scenarios this could be a valid use case)\r\n\r\nIf instead one doesn't just delete the buffer, but wipes it with `:bw`, then doing `Ctrl-^` as above, one gets the error \"E23: No alternate file\".\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI believe that for the vast majority of use-cases, it would be practical that when deleting/wiping a buffer, another buffer predictably becomes the alternate buffer. The most obvious candidate would be closest other listed buffer in the jumplist.",
