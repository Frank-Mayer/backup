But in the end of `make install` there was a warning message `WARNING: Target \"nvim_bin\" has EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL set and will not be built by default but an install rule has been provided for it.  CMake does not define behavior for this case.`, and it appeared that the install did not complete. In the end `$HOME/neovim` is not present.\n\nBTW I used exactly the same process and dependencies to build v0.9.2 without any issue.\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim.git \ncd neovim\ngit checkout tags/v0.10.2\nmake CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS=\"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/neovim\"\nmake install\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the install to complete with the files installed to the specified destination.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\ntags/v0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNA\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nCentOS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNA\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",

Why doesn't that work?\n\nAhh... a while ago I tried downloading the latest cmake binary at that time and it didn't run for some reason. But given your comment I tried again with the current latest version (3.30.5), it worked! Sorry for jumping to conclusions without trying.\n\nSo, build install Neovim v0.10.2 worked with the latest cmake-3.30.5. I thought that the version I used before (3.13.4) should work since in `BUILD.md` it was written that only cmake 3.13+ is needed. You can close this issue unless you want to investigate the compatibility issue with cmake-3.13.4. But maybe please do update `BUILD.md`. Thank you again.",
