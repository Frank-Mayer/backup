This applies to the design of interfaces. (Typing into this `html <form>` on github.com is not being rendered in monospace, nor are these posts outside of `<code>` elements or any of the rest of this inerface.)\r\n\r\nPeople are raving about Obsidian for diary/documentation/notes/etc, and its UI design is reasonably acceptable. Nvim's lua plugin \"ecosystem\" can achieve all/or-most of Obsidians functionality (and filling in any gaps would be completely attainable) but Nvim can't render fonts in a sane way and thus can't achieve an acceptable interface design to rival Obsidian.\r\n\r\nEmacs GUI's, as demonstrated in the screenshot above, *do* have font rendering that's acceptable by standard UI design expectations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPS:\r\n\r\nIn `README.md` the first *feature* listed is: \"Modern GUIs\". But outside the context of code editing these GUI's are don't look modern...\r\n\r\nLooking forward to when this can be prioritized!!! Any chance that could happen for `0.10.0`?",
