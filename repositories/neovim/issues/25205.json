As such, the default directories will always be used if no manual intervention is taken.\r\n\r\nFor the log file, it is not created with a file extension. Text editors like Notepad can still open it and view its contents. Although it should be noted that log files created by plugins such as lsp, luasnip, and mason have the `.log` file extension. The lack of a the file extension does not pose a significant issue, as it merely makes the user select a program to open it with, rather than automatically open the file with the default text editor if it had a file extension like `.txt` or `.log`.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that the log file directory is controlled by `$XDG_STATE_HOME`. In that case, I think it would be appropriate to note that the State Directory, `$XDG_STATE_HOME`, also controls the location of the log files in the documentation.",
