It was when I was verifying that I had properly relocated all of my Neovim files through the usage of [`stdpath(\"cache\")`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/builtin.html#stdpath()) that I realized that information regarding the cache directory was not provided. I had to use a [third party website](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/21824/how-to-control-cache-folder-location) to resolve my issue due to the cache folder not being properly documented.\r\n\r\nIf possible, information on the corresponding directories and environment variables of `stdpath(\"config_dirs\")`, `stdpath(\"data_dirs\")`, and `stdpath(\"log\")` should also be provided in the [Standard Paths documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#standard-path).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nInformation of the cache directory and its corresponding environment variable ($XDG_CACHE_HOME) should be present in the [Standard Paths documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#standard-path).
