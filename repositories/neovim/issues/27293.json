    "body": "### Problem\n\nI'm not sure what the policy is about implementing unreleased LSP features, but LSP 3.18 contains `textDocument/rangesFormatting`, which formats multiple ranges with a single request. I think this would be a very nice addition. But I can understand if we first want to wait for the 3.18 spec to be released. Then we can reopen this issue when it's time :)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe `range` parameter of `vim.lsp.buf.format` should support taking a list of ranges (which would then be forwarded to rangesFormatting instead of rangeFormatting)",
