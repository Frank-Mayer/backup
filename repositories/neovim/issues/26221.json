I looked in https://github.com/mauke/unibilium/blob/master/uniutil.c#L174 and attempted to set `TERMINFO` and `HOME` to appropriate values, but had no success.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear how to solve this problem cleanly, it appears the docs do not cover Windows build behaviors.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nwinget install wez.wezterm\r\n\r\nIn ~/.wezterm.lua:\r\n```\r\nlocal wezterm = require(\"wezterm\")\r\nlocal config = {}\r\nconfig = wezterm.config_builder()\r\nconfig.term = \"wezterm\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nStart nvim. Enter insert mode, observe cursor does not change modes.\r\n\r\nOpen `help term`, observe references to removed legacy feature `ttybuiltin`.\r\n\r\nOpen `help startup-terminal`, observe that while there is a description that a terminfo database will be used if available, and Unibilium is the library in use, attempts to install a terminfo database along with setting `HOME`, `TERMINFO` or `TERMINFO_DIRS` fail to load a terminfo to address the problem. There is no further description of the apparent difference in configuration on Windows, nor any way to add to or influence or even use members of the builtin mapping.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- A mapping of TERM=wezterm to xterm-256color until there is builtin terminfo for this terminal\r\n- Documentation as to how terminfo can be configured on Windows\r\n- Neovim on Windows running under Wezterm has functional title sets, cursor changes, and so on.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.9.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nunknown\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwezterm 20230712-072601-f4abf8fd\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nwezterm\n\n### Installation\n\nrepo",

            "body": "I had a similar issue. I couldn't get undercurl to work correctly using Neovim on Windows. Although, it worked perfectly fine when using WSL. I tried copying the `xterm-256color` binary from my WSL setup to Windows but still Neovim wasn't using that `.termfile` for some reason (executing `:echo &term` still showed `builtin-xterm` and not `xterm-256color`).\r\n\r\nUsing Visual Studio I was able to check that Unibilium is getting the `.terminfo` correctly when `TERMINFO` env variable is set. Reviewing the source code apparently is an issue of how Windows interprets some characters inside the `.terminfo` file. In the binary, there are some `\\x1a` characters (ASCII 26 in decimal). This is equivalent to `Ctrl + Z`, which on Windows represents the **End Of File**. Therefore, Unibilium tries to read each byte, but when it encounters the `\\x1a`, it stops counting how many bytes it has read.\r\n\r\n```\r\nunibi_term *unibi_from_fd(int fd) {\r\n    char buf[MAX_BUF];\r\n    size_t n;\r\n    ssize_t r;\r\n\r\n    for (n = 0; n < sizeof buf && (r = read(fd, buf + n, sizeof buf - n)) > 0; ) {\r\n        n += r;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (r < 0) {\r\n        return NULL;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return unibi_from_mem(buf, n);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n[Extracted from here.](https://github.com/neovim/unibilium/blob/ab28a2ddb86a144194a798bcf1fef1ab4f981ab7/uniutil.c#L66-L80)\r\n\r\nThis causes issues parsing the data to the corresponded `struct`, making Unibilium unable to set the `.terminfo` properties correctly. Actually, it is reading all the file perfectly fine, but `read` function is returning the wrong number of bytes that have been read.\r\n\r\nNow, Neovim when `.terminfo` wasn't correctly set, uses a hardcoded binary located inside `src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h` (if you are using a compatible `xcode` family terminal, it would use [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h#L2303-L2305)).\r\n\r\nChanging [this](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h#L2303-L2305) to whatever `.teminfo` data you want to use, and recompiling, is a workaround to fix the issue. A better solution would be to create a compatible `.terminfo` file for Windows.",
