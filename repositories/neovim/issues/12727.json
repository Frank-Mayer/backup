There should be a context menu in nvim which can be opened by a key combination in normal mode or a right click in all modes. \r\n\r\nWhile this can be done in an extension, it is worth building it in core for the following reasons:\r\n1) Standardization across plugins.\r\n2) Ensuring keyboard friendliness and making sure power users can find some use to it. \r\n\r\nThe context menu is not keyboard unfriendly. It can teach keyboard shortcuts. You press a button and get a list properly grouped into menu and sub-menu items. Then the user can either use hjkl or arrow keys to navigate through them or use the shortcut as in the normal mode.\r\n\r\nHere are some thoughts:\r\n```\r\nDelete (d) -> Start of word(w), A Word(aw), Inner word(iw), Till the end($), Current line(d)\r\nSystem Clipboard(\"+) -> Cut(d), Copy/Yank(y), Paste(p)\r\n--\r\nSpelling -> [Spell suggestions]\r\nGo -> Back(<C-o>), Forward(<C-i>)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNOTE: Tmux has a context menu. New developers introduced to tmux find this very useful. Not everyone remember all commands.",

Because you can put only so much into a small window and the few basic shortcuts which are shown there are so few and easy to remember that after the first day you know them and never need this feature again.\r\n\r\nI am against hardcoding something like this into neovim. The benefit would be very small and would target only at the first day users. I think there are plenty of tutorials out there and vimtutor exists. I certainly never felt like I needed something like this when I started using vim.\r\n\r\nIf anything much better would be to have a general interface for a popupwindow which can be populated by users and actions can be bound to keypresses for each element in the window. This wouldnt limit it to a context-menu and would enable users to modify it to their liking and plugin-builders to use it for other purposes. For example diagnostics-tools could populate it with fix-suggestions for errors and warnings. However, I am not sure if even something like this is necessary.",

Sadly afaik there's no way to make whichkey work nicely for neovim built-in commands, but with commands where I find the default to be bad for my workflow this works well.\r\n\r\nFor example I use \r\n```\r\n    noremap <leader>th :tab help<space>\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>tn :tabnew<CR>\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>tx :tabclose<CR>\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>tm :tabmove<space>\r\n    \r\n    \"Window close, split horizontal and split vertical\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>wx <C-W>c\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>wh <C-W>s\r\n    noremap <silent><leader>wv <C-W>v\r\n``` \r\nFor (IMO) better to use tab and window split control hotkeys\r\n\r\nThe way doom-emacs and spacemacs can enable hotkey discoverability for features that are default in vim is also pretty cool.
