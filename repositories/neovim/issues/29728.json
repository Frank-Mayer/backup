Neither does running `:set nofixendofline` or `:lua vim.opt.fixendofline = false` interactively. It just always adds a newline at the end of a file being saved.\r\n\r\nOn Linux, everything works as expected.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOn macOS, start with an an empty init.lua, add just `vim.opt.fixendofline = false`. Create a test file, e.g. with `printf 'foo\\nbar' >foo`. Confirm, e.g. with cat or hexdump, that the file doesn't end in a newline. Open it in nvim, `:wq`. Now foo does end in a newline. Running `:set nofixendofline` or `:lua vim.opt.fixendofline = false` interactively doesn't change this behaviour either. Tested with v0.9.4 as well as with the current master (v0.11.0-dev-422+g3c803483a / LuaJIT 2.1.1720049189) on macOS.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFile should not end in a newline if it didn't before saving, and none was added manually.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.11.0-dev-422+g3c803483a\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, 9.0\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOs 14.4.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niterm2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\ndownloaded master release binary from https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/nightly",
