    "body": "### Problem\n\nMoving the cursor up or down with `<count>k` and `<count>j` behaves differently than with just `k` and `j`. If `count` is big enough, the cursor jumps to the middle of the screen, instead of staying at the borders of the window (respecting `scrolloff`).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- `nvim --clean`\r\n- Create a file with many lines\r\n- Go to end of file and move cursor up with `50k` for example (50 is just a big number, greater than the window height)\r\n- Cursor jumps to middle of screen instead of staying on top\r\n\r\nThe same happens with `j` when moving down.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExpected `50k` to behave exactly the same as pressing `k` 50 times, but it does not: the latter stays at the top of the window (while also respecting configuration like `scrolloff`), while the former jumps to the middle of the screen. Analogously for `j`.\r\n\r\nThe behavior for `k` is caused by these lines:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/80cf0f3d29fa337d43ec417759cb061bd2798ea8/src/nvim/move.c#L317-L325\r\nI have built neovim running the else block unconditionally and can confirm that it solves the problem.\r\n\r\nFor `j` the logic is a bit more elaborate, I am only sure that it involves code around `scroll_cursor_halfway` in that same file.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior expected?\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nYes, vim 9.0.1676 ([issue](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/12675))\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nAlacritty 0.12.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nArch official repositories",
