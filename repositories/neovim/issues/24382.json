    "body": "### Problem\n\nMoving the cursor up or down with `<count>k` and `<count>j` behaves differently than with just `k` and `j`. If `count` is big enough, the cursor jumps to the middle of the screen, instead of staying at the borders of the window (respecting `scrolloff`).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- `nvim --clean`\r\n- Create a file with many lines\r\n- Go to end of file and move cursor up with `50k` for example (50 is just a big number, greater than the window height)\r\n- Cursor jumps to middle of screen instead of staying on top\r\n\r\nThe same happens with `j` when moving down.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExpected `50k` to behave exactly the same as pressing `k` 50 times, but it does not: the latter stays at the top of the window (while also respecting configuration like `scrolloff`), while the former jumps to the middle of the screen. Analogously for `j`.\r\n\r\nThe behavior for `k` is caused by these lines:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/80cf0f3d29fa337d43ec417759cb061bd2798ea8/src/nvim/move.c#L317-L325\r\nI have built neovim running the else block unconditionally and can confirm that it solves the problem.\r\n\r\nFor `j` the logic is a bit more elaborate, I am only sure that it involves code around `scroll_cursor_halfway` in that same file.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior expected?\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nYes, vim 9.0.1676 ([issue](https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/12675))\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nAlacritty 0.12.2\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nArch official repositories",

In vim when repeatedly pressing `k` in the middle of a long file the cursor only moves to the 6th line from the top of the screen before the text starts to scroll. In nvim the cursor will move all the way to the top of the screen before the text starts to scroll. Similar behavior happens when pressing `j` to move the cursor down the file.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to this question - when fixing issues do we want consistency with vim? ",
