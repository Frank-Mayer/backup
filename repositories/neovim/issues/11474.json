Has at least these advantages:\n\n- ✅ eliminates the https://github.com/neovim/lua-client dependency for running tests\n- ✅ eliminates https://github.com/neovim/lua-client and allows us to focus on Nvim as a client to itself\n- 🤏 test code (`helpers.lua`) can use the Nvim Lua stdlib, which eliminates lots of extra `helpers.lua` util functions.",

More work is needed for making the client play well within the nvim editor. In particular the client think it \"owns\" the luv loop (set callbacks; `luv.run()`, disable callbacks), while for plugins we need more something like register callbacks and then return back to let nvim handle the loop itself.
