Has at least these advantages:\r\n\r\n- eliminates the https://github.com/neovim/lua-client dependency for running tests\r\n- test code (`helpers.lua`) can use the Nvim Lua stdlib, which eliminates lots of extra `helpers.lua` util functions.\r\n- eliminates https://github.com/neovim/lua-client and allows us to focus on Nvim as a client to itself",

More work is needed for making the client play well within the nvim editor. In particular the client think it \"owns\" the luv loop (set callbacks; `luv.run()`, disable callbacks), while for plugins we need more something like register callbacks and then return back to let nvim handle the loop itself.
