    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nThe new neovim commenting feature is great. However, with the new commenting feature, the program breaks on commenting lines containing comments for c/cpp programs. For example consider\r\n\r\n```\r\nint a = 1;\r\n/*int b = 2;*/\r\nint c = 3;\r\n````\r\n\r\nCommenting these together by selecting using 'V' would lead to\r\n\r\n```\r\n/*int a = 1;*/\r\n/*/*int b = 2;*/*/\r\n/*int c = 3;*/\r\n````\r\n\r\nwhich is not valid C/C++ code. A simple fix for this would be to change the commentstring to '// %s' (in runtime/ftplugin/c.lua). Ideally, from reading previous issues, it seems this should be raised on vim/vim, but this is not a issue for vim due to the lack of inbuilt individual line based commenting (last I checked, feel free to correct me here). I add the same in my ftplugins, but a good default would be better.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCommenting\r\n\r\n```\r\nint a = 1;\r\n// int b = 2;\r\nint c = 3;\r\n````\r\n\r\nwould lead to \r\n```\r\n// int a = 1;\r\n// // int b = 2;\r\n// int c = 3;\r\n````\r\n\r\n(and appropriately for /*%s*/)\r\n\r\nEdit: I can submit a PR if required, just wanted to confirm if this would be an acceptable change.",

So in this instance I am actually inclined to make an exception -- not least of all because Neovim itself uses that form for comments in its codebase.\r\n\r\nOnly problem is that we would now need to go through the \"default\" commentstrings and decide whether they should remain the current default or be changed to match C.\r\n\r\n@neovim/core what do you think?",

It _should_ import `c.lua`, like `ftplugin/cpp.vim`.
