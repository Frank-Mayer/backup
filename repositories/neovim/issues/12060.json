    "body": "Really great work guys with nvim! I am impressed on how nvim is moving fast and how I've been left behind by sticking to vim. There is only one thing up to this day preventing me from changing to nvim.\r\n\r\nI like running my tests the way vim does, outside the editor, by basically putting the editor in background and using the terminal shell to run it. Why I like it? Because I can go back to the output with `CTRL+Z` and quickly bringing the editor back with `fg`.\r\n\r\nIs there a way of currently doing this in nvim? Or what would be the equivalent of doing `CTRL+z` for checking the output again?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. nvim\r\n2. `:! ls` or `:terminal ls`\r\n3. <C+Z>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nNo `ls` output in the terminal\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nFiles are listed just as if I had typed `ls` in the terminal by doing `<c-z>` `ls`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nThis [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46097571/how-to-run-scripts-in-background-in-neovim) compare vim/nvim and what is the option I would love to have.\r\n\r\nCan we please, please, pretty,  please have it? I know it is not much but I would be more than happy rewarding 100USD for whoever develops this retro-feature and gets it approved and shipped.",
