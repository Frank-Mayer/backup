Calls to `Iter.new()` always pay this cost and can't opt-out of it.\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/e928161bde262c238f79bc0fd84e60178ff6a321/runtime/lua/vim/iter.lua#L906-L917\r\n\r\nArguments in favor of the current logic?\r\n\r\n- Iter pipelines inherently are O(n) so doing an extra scan is a reasonable cost.\r\n- Handles unusual lists/arrays.\r\n\r\n\r\nRelated: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/24141\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nInstead of using `pairs()`, treat any table where `t[1] == nil` as non-list, and `t[1] ~= nil` as list. Change the logic to:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- Decide if the source table is a list.\r\nif src[1] == nil then\r\n  return Iter.new(pairs(src))\r\nend\r\nend\r\nreturn ListIter.new(ipairs(src))\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Advantages:**\r\n\r\n- easy to document and understand\r\n- fast\r\n\r\n**Disadvantages:**\r\n\r\n- may treat a non-list as a list, if `t[1]` is non-nil in a table that is intended as a dict\r\n    - callers can workaround this by setting `t[1] = nil`.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "A list-like table _must_ have consecutive integer indices starting at 1 if we want to be able to use the length (`#`) operator, which we make heavy use of for the list optimizations.\r\n\r\nFrom the [Lua reference manual](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.5) (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n>The length of a table t is defined to be any integer index n such that `t[n]` is not nil and `t[n+1]` is nil; moreover, if `t[1]` is nil, `n` can be zero. For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given `n`, its length is exactly that `n`, the index of its last value. **If the array has \"holes\" (that is, nil values between other non-nil values), then `#t` can be any of the indices that directly precedes a nil value (that is, it may consider any such nil value as the end of the array).**\r\n\r\nIt is insufficient to only check that `t[1] ~= nil` to infer that `t` is a list. A table such as `{ 'a', 'b', nil, 'd', 'e' }` might have length 5, or length 2. According to the standard, it's undefined.\r\n\r\nThe `pairs()` check in the constructor is kind of a bummer, it's obviously slow for large tables, but I don't know of a better way to ensure correct behavior.",
