For example, the C file I'm currently writing has a bunch of functions, but also a whole block of `#define`s for hardware pins. I would like to be able to `set foldmethod=marker,syntax`, and then enclose the block of `#define`s in `// {{{` and `// }}}` to be able to collapse them away, while still preserving syntax-based folding for the rest of the file.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt would be nice to allow at least `foldmethod=marker` and `foldmethod=manual` to exist concurrently with the automatic foldmethods (`syntax`, `indent`, `diff`, etc. ...).",
