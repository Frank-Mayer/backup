    "body": "This is a *tracking issue*, not a manifesto. Corrections welcome unless they are nit-picks.\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nThe C core of nvim has been armored by a lot of static analysis and compiler flags, which has greatly improved quality. But C still has these problems:\r\n\r\n- crashes from invalid pointers, arrays not bounds-checked\r\n- nul-terminated strings are awkward and have a perf cost\n- memory management takes effort and asan doesn't detect all the leaks\n- lack of modern language abstractions (e.g. generics) makes particular parts of the code over complicated and specialized (e.g. marktree, Lua/vimscript bridge).\r\n\r\n# Goal\r\n\r\nThe strategy of Nvim has always been to lift logic out of C and into Lua where possible. And that still looks like a productive path. But if there is a \"better C\" which allows us to completely *freeze* the remaining C bits and shift to the \"better C\", at near-zero cost, then we should consider that.\r\n\r\nC gives us the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- broad cross-platform support\r\n- fast builds\r\n- leverage existing C codebase\r\n\r\n# Proposal\r\n\r\nThis issue evaluates whether we can maintain the above benefits, while gaining new ones, by leveraging:\r\n\r\n## rust\r\n\r\n- pros\n    - tooling\r\n    - rich type system\r\n    - borrow checker gives strong guarantees\n    - language level macros\n    - large collection of libraries \n- cons\r\n    - slow build times\r\n    - interop with C libraries has nonzero friction\r\n    - mediocre cross-compiling support\r\n\r\n## zig\r\n\r\n- pros\r\n    - comptime\n      - replaces the Lua generator scripts that create C code (e.g. `gen_api_dispatch.lua`).\r\n    - zero-friction interop with legacy C code/libraries\r\n    - can easily cross-compile to mac/linux/win, from a single CI job\r\n    - can replace CMake: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/28344/\r\n- cons\r\n    - still in beta\r\n    - tooling not as good as C or Rust (e.g. LSP)\n\r\n## c++\r\n\r\n- cons\r\n    - conflicts with Lua's garbage collector, because it is garbage\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nprevious: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/8669\r\n",
