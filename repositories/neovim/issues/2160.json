Try it with gvim or MacVim or any Vim that has the `+browse` feature compiled in. E.g. `:browse e`. It usually opens a GUI-specific file selection dialog. I think restoring code from `src/gui_{athena,gtk_x11,mac,photon,...}` is not something we want.\n\nThere are 2 special cases that work differently and don't require `+browse`:\n\n1) `:browse set` which is the same  as `:options`. In Neovim `:browse set` is a no-op, but `:options` still works as intended. Nothing to do here.\n\n2) `:browse oldfiles`, which starts a simple TUI file selection. Actually this is the only case I see `:browse` being used for from time to time. (E.g. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3598)\n\nWhat do you think of only restoring `:browse oldfiles`? And since this would be the only use case for `:browse`, we could drop that command altogether and simply make `:oldfiles` always do the prompting automatically.\n\nYour opinions?\n",
