    "body": "### Problem\n\nSyntax's `conceal` feature has no way to use highlight groups other than Conceal, and `matchadd` has the same problem. Treesitter highlighting through highlights.scm does allow the user to select any highlight group, but the feature isn't nearly as powerful as syntax (no regex before and after the match, for example). \r\n\r\nRelevant: `:h :syn-conceal`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAn argument like syntax's cchar, such as `syntax match 'pattern' conceal cchar=C cgroup=Group`. This would be incredibly useful, as to the best of my knowledge the only way to achieve the same level of functionality as syntax without being limited to one highlight group is with virtual text, which is significantly more cumbersome. I really see no downside to implementing a feature like this, and frankly I'm surprised it doesn't already exist.",
