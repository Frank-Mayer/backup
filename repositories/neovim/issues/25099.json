Use the tippy-top of nightly Neovim.\r\n2. In a `lua` file write:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal foo = {\r\n  bar = 0,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Hover over `bar`.\r\n4. Notice how the parentheses around `field` are underlined (the `MatchParen` highlight is being applied) despite my cursor being in an entirely different window:\r\n<img width=\"253\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/62502207/c9ec2fbc-eefa-4001-9efe-d5eb7107932d\">\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor the `MatchParen` highlight to only be applied in active windows and based on the cursor position.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.0-dev-1074+g4258f4d53\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nMac Ventura 13.5.2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.28.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nFrom source",

MatchParen uses a `WinLeave` autocommand to clear highlights in the non-active window. When the float is created, it copies everything from the current window (including MatchParen highlights), but a `WinLeave` autocommand is never triggered, so the highlight is never cleared.\r\n\r\nI see the same thing with `'cursorline'` (I have a `WinLeave` autocommand to clear `'cursorline'` in non-active windows).\r\n\r\nWe don't see this with e.g. `:new` or `:split` because when a split is created, the new window is entered, which triggers a `WinLeave` event on the original window.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best solution is. Firing a `WinLeave` event after creating a float doesn't seem semantically correct, since the float was never entered in the first place. ",
