Enable clangd: I have ''neovim/nvim-lspconfig' installed and clang enabled via require('lspconfig').clangd.setup{}\n2. Create a symlink to your project. I have /home/user/ssd -> /home_ssd/user, so my symlink path is /home/user/ssd/sources/pioneer and the real path is /home_ssd/user/sources/pioneer.\n3. cd to your project using the symlink so the pwd will print the symlink dir\n4. Build the compilation database. For https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer I just need to call ./bootstrap.\n5. ln project root directory: ln -s build/compile_commands.json (this is not the problematic symlink)\n6. Check contents of compile_commands.json - all files should be with full symlink path like: /home/user/ssd/sources/pioneer/src/lua/core/Import.cpp\n7. Run nvim in root of the project.\n8. Open some cpp file and try to find references of some symbol, they will be found only in opened file(s).\n   .cache/clangd/index will not be creaetd\n\nIf the compilation database is created with real paths everything works fine. It can be achieved by navigating to the sandbox via real path:\ncd /home_ssd/user/sources/pioneer\nand starting:\n./bootstrap\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI should work like in vim with ALE plugin and clangd. Even with the compilation database with symlink paths it can initiate clangd to work properly and find references in the whole project no matter if you navigate to the sandbox via symlink or real path.\n\n\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-1090+g99acc9de55\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nDebian clangd version 16.0.6 (27+b1)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian testing\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",

When the option is added this will not solve the issue in nvim automatically, it would still need to use this new option.\n2. As I mentioned the retrovim with ALE plugin is able to behave correctly with the same version of clangd so I do not think it is a clangd dproblem or, at least, the problem can be solved without changes in clangd.\n\nIt also seems to me that the clang issues are about different use case and will probably not solve this problem.\n\nPlease reopen.",

The issue I frequently run into is go-to-definition bringing me to the declaration in the header file instead of the actual definition in the source file when the source file is inside a symlinked directory as represented in compile_commands.json.\n\nLooking at the LSP's logs, we see clangd is indeed returning the header file as the location of the definition (until I manually open the source file, then clangd will start returning the source file):\n\n```\n[ERROR][2024-12-29 15:06:22] ...p/_transport.lua:36     \"rpc\"   \"clangd\"        \"stderr\"        \"I[15:06:22.150] <-- textDocument/definition(6)\\n\"\n[ERROR][2024-12-29 15:06:22] ...p/_transport.lua:36     \"rpc\"   \"clangd\"        \"stderr\"        \"V[15:06:22.150] ASTWorker running Definitions on version 0 of /Users/brax/projects/sandbox/clangd-symlink/main/main.c\\n\"\n[ERROR][2024-12-29 15:06:22] ...p/_transport.lua:36     \"rpc\"   \"clangd\"        \"stderr\"        \"I[15:06:22.151] --> reply:textDocument/definition(6) 0 ms\\n\"\n[ERROR][2024-12-29 15:06:22] ...p/_transport.lua:36     \"rpc\"   \"clangd\"        \"stderr\"        'V[15:06:22.151] >>> {\"id\":6,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"result\":[{\"range\":{\"end\":{\"character\":8,\"line\":0},\"start\":{\"character\":5,\"line\":0}},\"uri\":\"file:///Users/brax/projects/sandbox/clangd-symlink/symlink/foo.h\"}]}\\n\\n'\n```\n\nSo at least in my case, there's clearly nothing Neovim can be expected to reasonably do here. It's simply getting the \"wrong answer\" from clangd. I think burden of proof would be on OP to prove that Neovim is doing something wrong in his specific case, because it still sounds like a clangd issue -- Neovim has no control over how clangd indexes the project.",
