Enable clangd: I have ''neovim/nvim-lspconfig' installed and clang enabled via require('lspconfig').clangd.setup{}\n2. Create a symlink to your project. I have /home/user/ssd -> /home_ssd/user, so my symlink path is /home/user/ssd/sources/pioneer and the real path is /home_ssd/user/sources/pioneer.\n3. cd to your project using the symlink so the pwd will print the symlink dir\n4. Build the compilation database. For https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer I just need to call ./bootstrap.\n5. ln project root directory: ln -s build/compile_commands.json (this is not the problematic symlink)\n6. Check contents of compile_commands.json - all files should be with full symlink path like: /home/user/ssd/sources/pioneer/src/lua/core/Import.cpp\n7. Run nvim in root of the project.\n8. Open some cpp file and try to find references of some symbol, they will be found only in opened file(s).\n   .cache/clangd/index will not be creaetd\n\nIf the compilation database is created with real paths everything works fine. It can be achieved by navigating to the sandbox via real path:\ncd /home_ssd/user/sources/pioneer\nand starting:\n./bootstrap\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI should work like in vim with ALE plugin and clangd. Even with the compilation database with symlink paths it can initiate clangd to work properly and find references in the whole project no matter if you navigate to the sandbox via symlink or real path.\n\n\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-1090+g99acc9de55\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nDebian clangd version 16.0.6 (27+b1)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian testing\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
