It is useful in GUIs for visual feedback. For example, in Insert mode, the mouse shape is typically an I-Beam whereas it is an Arrow in Normal mode. When hovering over a split or status line, it becomes a left-right or up-down shape to indicate the element can be resized.\r\n\r\nThis option is implemented in Vim and is used by the MacVim GUI for this purpose. It would be good if Neovim also allowed this option to be set by the user and provided this information to GUIs so they can set the mouse pointer shape as appropriate.",
