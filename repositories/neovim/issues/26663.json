It is hard to describe in word, so hopefully the following GIFs can clarify what I mean.\r\n\r\n![kitty_terminal_nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6849129/89a3aa4f-499f-473e-96ab-9a58b669979c)\r\n\r\nThis only happens in the Kitty terminal emulator. I also tested it in the Gnome terminal and there the problem does not exist. Furthermore it only happens with version 0.10. If I go back to the latest stable version of Neovim (0.9.4) the issues does not occur (neither in Kitty nor Gnome terminal).\r\n\r\n- no nvim config (using `--clean`)\r\n- not kitty customization (no `kitty.conf`)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```shell\r\nnvim --clean\r\n:term<CR>\r\n[...start typing]\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe cursor in terminal mode should not look and behave like this\r\n\r\n![gnome_terminal](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/6849129/831bf2bd-b617-4d64-ae38-3fc8e1a03d60)\r\n\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-dc9f7b8\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI don't know\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nPop!_OS 22.04 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkitty 0.31.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-kitty\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage",
