    "body": "### Feature already in Vim?\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Feature description\r\n\r\nToday, when you call `vim.lsp.start_client({...})`, an external process is eventually spawned using `vim.loop.spawn(...)` (aka `uv.spawn`). For libraries that provide alternate means of communicating with LSP processes that need direct control over the spawning, it is currently required to temporarily overwrite the spawn method:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- Must overwrite with this before calling vim.lsp.start_client\r\nvim.loop.spawn = function(cmd, spawn_params, on_exit)\r\n    local pid = 123\r\n    local handle = {\r\n        -- ...\r\n    }\r\n    return handle, pid\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the case of [distant.nvim](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim), the upcoming release is going to switch to using a shared object Rust library where we talk to remote processes. Today, this involves spawning a proxy process per LSP. Tomorrow, this should just have the library inject itself in the creation process and return a handler that provides all of the same methods.\r\n\r\n* `handle:is_closing()`\r\n* `handle:close([callback])`\r\n* `handle:kill(signum)`\r\n* Working with `uv.new_pipe(false)` created for stdin, stdout, and stderr all of which are supplied as arguments to `uv.spawn`\r\n    * `stdout:read_start(...)`\r\n    * `stderr:read_start(...)`\r\n    * `stdin:write(...)`\r\n\r\nTalking with @tjdevries about this briefly on discord, the scalable idea here would be to allow passing a function that can be called, defaulting to `uv.spawn` if none is provided. Depending on the complexity of working with uv pipes, we may need to abstract a little bit more to allow a function that returns a handle AND stdin, stdout, and stderr which all mirror the uv pipe methods. This is because we may not be able to work with the uv pipes directly if they don't actually connect to anything local.\r\n\r\nThis is something I hope to tackle before the next neovim release.",

It's a lua module that - through the hack described above - returns a matching handle and pipes. While distant communicates over TCP to a remote server, the actual LSP communication is done over stdio. Distant relays stdin, stdout, and stderr between the LSP and neovim, but to neovim it would look like it is talking to a local process over stdin. At least, that's how it works today.\r\n\r\nThis way, there's no dependence on a remote LSP server supporting TCP itself. Distant takes care of all of that for you.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"574\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2481802/137681931-525cbc6e-ab1b-42d8-b2e6-1bc11fc62a1b.png\">\r\n",

Maybe my original post was unclear in retrospect, I'm lumping anything that is not a `uv_spawn`'d server over stdio together.\r\n\r\nOkay, my misunderstanding :) I would just prefer to avoid writing too much special logic to handle LSPs within distant. For the most part, distant treats an LSP server like any other remote process and just acts as the bridge to forward stdin, stdout, and stderr back and forth. So if I can keep that functionality and plug it into neovim's `vim.lsp.start_client` in some way by providing an alternate version of spawning and pipes, I'm a happy camper!",
