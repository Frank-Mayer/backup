    "body": "@erw7:\r\n\r\n> Related to #11259: `gettext()` calls `getenv()` internally, so I think we need the same exclusive control as #11259. However, the TUI thread does not include a `gettext()` call, so only os_getenv() can be called during a `gettext()` call. ISO/IEC 9899:1999 has the following description of `getenv()`.\r\n>\r\n> ```\r\n> The string pointed to shall not be modified by the program, but may\r\n> be overwritten by a subsequent call to the getenv function.\r\n> ```\r\n>\r\n> Therefore, strictly speaking, exclusive control is necessary. I'm wondering if there are any implementations that actually need exclusive control, but should `gettext` be controlled exclusively?\r\n\r\n\r\n@justinmk:\r\n\r\n> wouldn't this problem exist even if we were using gettext + getenv (not\r\n> the os_getenv wrapper) ?\r\n\r\n@erw7:\r\n\r\n> Regardless of whether or not `os_getenv()` is used, it is necessary to call\r\n> `getenv()`, `setenv()`, and unsetenv() exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think we shouldn't worry about this. neovim/neovim#10071 will reduce the need for an extra thread.\r\n\r\nPlan:\r\n\r\n- we should focus on eliminating the extra thread .\r\n- we should avoid using env vars in the TUI thread.\r\n- we definitely should not use gettext there.\r\n- E.g. `$TERM` could be passed from the main thread, to the TUI thread, from `ui_builtin_start()`.\r\n- We could add `unibi_from_params` which takes parameters instead of checking the environment itself.\r\n",
