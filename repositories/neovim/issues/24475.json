However, custom hl groups and highlighting patterns (like for underlining urls) make them perform horribly and look ugly compared to using native `f`/`F`.\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2023-07-24 at 8 00 26 PM](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/56745535/992f9f29-1785-4c82-9f2b-06e12a5d1994)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThere are already macro events like `RecordingEnter` and `RecordingLeave`. It would be cool if there were also autocmd events for macro execution. This way functionality like hlgroups, highlighting patterns, etc. can be disabled to improve performance when executing a macro that invokes a motion plugin in addition to avoiding visual clutter and flickering on the screen. Maybe an optional regex pattern could be provided to match macros that involve certain keys or sequences of keys. \r\n\r\nThanks for your consideration!",
