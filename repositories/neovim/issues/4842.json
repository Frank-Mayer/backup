If you use  `--cmd` in place of `-c` then the effect will be the same with and without `--headless` because UI was not started yet, if you still use `-c` then you will need to use `>/dev/null` to avoid clobbering the view for the time Neovim is running, but this is not actually necessary because UI writes to stdout and thus redirection of stderr works absolutely fine.\n\nSecond variant makes more sense in this case: it will be empty in `--cmd` as well, but I still do not see what this is for, you do not need to know UI status to write to `/dev/stderr` and #4772 talks about using this in the shell scripts meaning that you have plenty of ways to tell your plugin or whatever to write to stderr (environment variable, `-c 'let g:var = 1'`, â€¦).\n",
