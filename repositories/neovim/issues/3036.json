It's the same flaw that makes the (well-intentioned) [NASA Open Source Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Open_Source_Agreement) incompatible with \"actual\" licensesâ€”including, e.g., the GPL.  It requires that the contributions be the submitters' own code, which rules out the above scenario.\n\nThis section exists because:\n1. You don't want some contributor introducing legally conflicting code because they found it on the 'net and think that makes it public domain.\n2. You don't want anyone introducing legally conflicting code when their work arrangement stipulates that all their work belongs to their employer but their employer hasn't actually signed off on open sourcing this contribution (in which case you get their employer to sign the CLA)\n\nNotice how [MPL 2.0 section 2.5](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/#representation) handles this.  It simply requires that the submitter assert that if the patches contain any third-party code, then the code must be conflict-free.\n\nThis should be fixed in one of two ways:\n1. Amend section 3 of the Neovim CLA to address this similar to the way the MPL does, or\n2. Get rid of the CLA altogether.  Anyone doing #1 from above can't exactly be trusted to begin with, so it's not actually any use there, and otherwise, the project operating in contradiction of its own CLA is proof that nobody is reading it anyway, which means the only real effect it has is to introduce unnecessary process and friction for contributors.\n",

If we have problems, they have big problems.\n  - ...except I just noticed this blog post: https://www.joyent.com/blog/broadening-node-js-contributions (also [here](http://blog.nodejs.org/2014/06/11/notes-from-the-road/))\n  - note, however, that we explicitly **do not** request copyright assignment \n\nAddressing your specific comments:\n\n> Does the Neovim CLA allow this? No.\n\nWhy do you think that? Anything third-party thing that is incorporated into the project lives under its license. Furthermore, our LICENSE and README.md explicitly state that Vim patches in particular are copyrighted by their original authors and are licensed under the Vim license.\n\n> It requires that the contributions be the submitters' own code,\n\nRight, the Contribution. I doubt that any court or legal department would understand a third-party component or module which includes its license, as being a Contribution by the person who happens to commit it. That is, a third-party component is not a Contribution. So the CLA does not apply to it. \n\n> It requires that the contributions be the submitters' own code, which rules out the above scenario.\n\nBy that logic, the FSF's extremely strict CLA would preclude them from ever incorporating other GPL works into FSF projects (except by direct submission of the copyright holders of those works). That would be amusing.\n\n> Notice how MPL 2.0 section 2.5 handles this.\n\nIs that a license or a CLA? If we want to change the license, we need consent of the copyright holders, unless they signed the CLA. Good thing we did that ;)\n\n> Anyone doing #1 from above can't exactly be trusted to begin with, so it's not actually any use there, \n\nIts primary use is to demonstrate due-diligence; it's understood that we cannot control or prevent malfeasance.\n\n> which means the only real effect it has is to introduce unnecessary process and friction for contributors.\n\nRemoving friction is a high priority, but our CLA is pretty low-friction. (Of course, zero is better than almost zero)\n\nAt any rate, the tide seems to be turning against CLAs:\n- http://news.slashdot.org/story/14/01/20/2158221/linus-torvalds-any-cla-is-fundamentally-broken\n- http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/29160.html\n- http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2014/06/09/do-not-need-cla.html\n\nI never wanted a CLA. I did a lot of searching 1 year ago, and decided (1) it would be in the best interest of the project and (2) it would help users and plugin authors feel confident about using the project for their applications.\n\nA few months ago I noted the DCO option: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2306 . Would like to hear from anyone who has experience with that.\n",

Good thing we did that\n\nThere are two groups we're discussing here: the original authors of the third-party code, and the Neovim contributors who incorporated the code into the project.  You'll have a signed CLA on file for the latter, but not the former.  But if you hope to change the license for some reason, the latter is not going to be much help, because the former is who you'll need to seek consent from.\n",

In the CLA, a \"Contribution\" is defined as \"software, bug fixes, configuration changes, documentation, or any other materials that you send to us related to the Project\", which almost certainly includes third party libraries that are included as part of a pull request (\"any other materials\"). Clause 1 says Apache 2.0 and Clause 2 says that the submitter must have the legal authority to grant that license, which is _not_ the case for third party libraries. Clause 3 even specifies that Contributions are \"are [submitters] original work\", and if you accept that a Contribution _does_ include third party libraries, then you're outright denying the inclusion of code that somebody didn't specifically write for Neovim.\n\nIP contracts (and that's exactly what the CLA is) aren't something to mess around with. I'd categorize this as a very serious problem.\n",

It was pretty clear _to me_ that @colbyrussell was saying that if one sends a pull request with the **_contents**_ of _someone else's_ work (either verbatim or derivative), then the CLA (as it stood in [the revision posted](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1u54bpbwzneDIRltFx1TGi2evKxY3w0cOV3vlpj8DPbg/viewform)) would consider that code a Contribution per the definition therein, though the CLA would deem that contribution unacceptable as the code wouldn't be \"original work\" (as required per Clause 3 of the CLA).\n\nWhen asked multiple times if @colbyrussell was suggesting that _references_ to third-party works (say, linking via `pkg-config` to a shared library, or something along those lines) was a contribution of the code thereof, he repeatedly clarified that that's not what he meant. Admittedly, @colbyrussell seemed to lose a little patience towards the end, but I can't blame him, given that he was subjected to the same question repeatedly (which wasn't a very [charitable interpretation[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) to begin with).\n\nI believe @colbyrussell raised a valid concern, and I feel compassion for him when I see him coming under attack for being \"smug\", when it's apparent that he's just trying to help out.\n\nI don't think there was any malice intended on either side; however, as an outsider looking in, it would also be easy for me to interpret how this unfolded as \"neovim is a hostile project where issues are interpreted in the most uncharitable way possible, and then you're called names when you get exasperated after repeatedly trying to clarify that _you're not irrational_ - you're just being _treated_ that way\".\n\nAgain, I don't believe any malice was intended. I do, however, think that it would benefit the project if there was some recognition of how this (probably) felt for @colbyrussell, and a recognition that better communication could have avoided this. We're all guilty of miscommunication at times, but - as with all skills - taking ownership of mistakes is necessary to improve. **In other words, I'm not questioning your character.**\n\n---\n\n[1]: \"In philosophy and rhetoric, the principle of charity requires interpreting a speaker's statements to be rational and, in the case of any argument, considering its best, strongest possible interpretation.\"\n",
