    "body": "The RPC [nvim_ui_attach](https://neovim.io/doc/user/api.html#nvim_ui_attach()), which is used by most GUIs, sends a bunch of default \"redraw\" events. Adding parameters to this RPC results in more events being sent to the caller.\r\n\r\nThe Lua layer has a similarly-named [vim.ui_attach](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua.html#vim.ui_attach()) function, which behaves in the exact opposite way: you are supposed to subscribe to the events you want and get none by default.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, it's important for these two functions to behave in the same way. Doing otherwise is prone to confusion and makes learning Neovim's API harder for plugin and UI developers. Moreover, to my uninformed eye, it looks like this is perhaps also the cause of other existing issues (e.g. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20482 ).",
