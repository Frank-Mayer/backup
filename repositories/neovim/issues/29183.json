    "body": "### Problem\n\n`vim.lsp.completion` is essentially a completion engine upstreamed into core. Right now it can’t really replace external completion engines like nvim-cmp since it doesn’t allow other plugins to register new completion sources. That’s really unfortunate, since unified API for providing completions could solve the N*M problem here (N completion providers communicating with M completion engines).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n- `vim.lsp.completion` gains an API that allows plugins to register their own completion sources. Probably a couple of them (like “buffer words” or “FS paths”) could be provided with default runtime.\r\n- Ideally it also provides an API to allow an external completion engine to query all registered completion sources or register itself as a “completion UI”, similar to `vim.ui` APIs. That would allow completion UIs that are too complex to be accepted into core to benefit from the unified API.\r\n- It probably makes sense to move `vim.lsp.completion` to `vim.completion`, as it happened with `vim.lsp.diagnostics`.",
