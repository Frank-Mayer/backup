    "body": "## Problem\r\n\r\nWith `notermguicolors` the default colorscheme pulls all its colors from the 17-255. This is a bold change from the old default colorscheme which only uses the [0-15 ansi colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors). The benefit this had was that it used whatever color palette was defined in the terminal, and thus whatever the user configures themselves. Now the new default colorscheme is quite jaring and completely deviates from the colors used in the terminal.\r\n\r\nNote I think it's good to distinguish the two components of a colorscheme which often get conflated:\r\n1. The palette. The actual values for each color, e.g. What is red, blue, etc.\r\n2. How the palette is used.\r\n\r\nThis issue only wishes to change how palette is determined with `notermguicolors`, not how it is used.\r\n\r\nAlso note, I believe the old default colorscheme only had issues with 2 which #26334 addresses very well.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nThe current color palette almost falls into the 16 color space, however it contains 20 colors as it uses 8 colors for gray.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDark:\r\nblue    = \"#005078\"\r\ncyan    = \"#007676\"\r\ngreen   = \"#015825\"\r\ngrey1   = \"#0a0b10\"\r\ngrey2   = \"#1c1d23\"\r\ngrey3   = \"#2c2e33\"\r\ngrey4   = \"#4f5258\"\r\nmagenta = \"#4c0049\"\r\nred     = \"#5e0009\"\r\nyellow  = \"#6e5600\"\r\n\r\nLight:\r\nblue    = \"#9fd8ff\"\r\ncyan    = \"#83efef\"\r\ngreen   = \"#aaedb7\"\r\ngrey1   = \"#ebeef5\"\r\ngrey2   = \"#d7dae1\"\r\ngrey3   = \"#c4c6cd\"\r\ngrey4   = \"#9b9ea4\"\r\nmagenta = \"#ffc3fa\"\r\nred     = \"#ffbcb5\"\r\nyellow  = \"#f4d88c\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore we should be able to rework the colorscheme to only use the `cterm0-15` colors and provide a terminal configuration for users who wish use the new Nvim palette. Since the palette requires 4 additional colors either:\r\n- pull these from the 17-255 space.\r\n- merge these shades of grey into white, black, \"dark white\" and \"bright black\".\r\n\r\n\r\n## Other points:\r\n- The current `notermguicolors` differs quite a bit to the `termguicolors` version. If instead we use\r\nthe 0-15 space and provide a terminal configuration, then it is possible for the `notermguicolors` version\r\nto much more closely match the `termguicolors` version. If the user wishes.\r\n  - This will be useful for anyone who SSH's into machines that have Neovim but not their default config and/or without the correct terminfo to enable truecolor.\r\n- The 256 color set is not usually configurable in terminals.\r\n   - Wezterm **does allow** defining the full 256 range via OSC escape sequences: https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/escape-sequences.html#operating-system-command-sequences\r\n- Defining a background will change/disrupt any setups who use transparent terminals.",

Even though I use a terminal with truecolor support, I still often find I'm in situtations where the shell isn't properly set up. Therefore I still think it's important that the `nvim -u NONE` works as best it can in as many environements as possible and I don't think using 16 colors degrades the experience much since the colorscheme is only 20 colors. If it required a larger set of the 255 space then that would tip the argument.\r\n\r\n> Since we can't meet both, we need to be ready to compromise, or have good objective arguments why the project favors one over the other.\r\n\r\nI would have thought the option that is adaptive and synergizes with other systems is much more of the Nvim ethos as opposed to: \"you will use these colors!\". Honestly, the fact that the scheme is mostly blue/green is opionative enough. Further forcing the palette is just going too far for the default scheme.\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, the whole 256 color thing never properly took off and is now superseded by truecolor. Whereas 16 color is still very much prevalent and is what most CLI applications stick too.\r\n\r\nI think the compromise is that the `termguicolors` variant is the authoritive \"this is our colorscheme!\".

Since the palette requires 4 additional colors either:\r\n> \r\n>     * pull these from the 17-255 space.\r\n> \r\n>     * merge these shades of grey into white, black, \"dark white\" and \"bright black\".\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, non of these approaches are fully possible. For text foreground (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan) - yes, it is a matter of straightforward replacement, as those correspond to terminal colors (with intent of compatibility, as it is).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to text background it is a bit less straightforward, as it needs to be different from what is used in the foreground (or it will lead to no text at all). So such highlight groups should only have non-colored foreground. I think it is already the case in default, but not entirely sure.\r\n\r\nThe most problematic is indeed 4 additional grey colors. They define how UI looks. Pulling these from 16-255 space will not lead to entirely usable palette, as those can equal to some of user's 0-15.\r\n\r\nMerging shades into 0, 7, 8, 15 will also result into not really usable palette as there needs to be shade distinctions in the following levels: NormalFloat - Normal (bg) - CursorLine and Pmenu - Visual - Comment - StatusLineNC - Normal (fg). Those are not really possible to merge into 4 shades and still have a usable UI (I tried). The only route I could find is to go Vim's one: underlined `CursorLine`, reverse `Visual`, magenta `Pmenu` and `NormalFloat`. I would advise against that.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nI know the next question might sound a bit snarky, but I assure you it is not. Why the 16 colors? Why not 8 colors, as I am sure there are only 8 colors terminals out there.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n > Keep in mind 256 colors is the default experience for new users and `nvim --clean`.\r\n\r\nThat is one of the main reasons why I consider having *good* visual UI for `tgc` is important. And I personally could not find one with less than 4 shades of dark and 4 shades of light greys.",

Termguicolors is the official, yes I agree. What I'm arguing is the fallback (notermguicolors) should preferably be chosen from 16-255 colors, because neovim assumes t_Co = 256 by default so we should make use of that range instead of strictly 0-15 colour indexes",

Which colors should be used for `notgc` is more a matter of preference and executive decision.\r\n\r\nI personally probably still prefer using 16-255. But as a default color scheme to be used by broader audience, having `notgc` viewed as somewhat intentional choice to not use `tgc` results into colors 0-15 being more organic. So they are proposed in the new iteration of color scheme (#26540).",

It survived the initial removal of t_xx options (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/3baba1e7bc6698e6bc9f1d37fce88b30d6274bc9), and then later got removed because it \"has never worked\" and \"should not have worked\" (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/944e3c06193f6d10baa9ba3021e01626337dd884) despite the fact that it was possible to set/get t_Co value and `lookup_colors` does use this value to make default colorscheme utilize 256 colors when available and fallback to 16 when it's not. I don't know how it actually behaved at that time, so please let me know. cc @justinmk.~~\r\n\r\n~~If t_Co is revived (and assuming that it works), it's a win-win.~~\r\n* ~~Users who want uniform terminal colorscheme experience can set t_Co=16, which is a marginal addition to set notgc already necessitated due to tgc now being default when available.~~\r\n* ~~Users who use terminals without tgc support can have better colorscheme by default.~~\r\n* ~~Users who use terminals without 256 colors support also gets good-ish 16 color colorscheme by default.~~\r\n\r\n~~If t_Co is technically possible, what needs to be decided is whether achieving this win-win situation outweighs the complexity of maintaining t_Co option and implementing the fallback for the default colorscheme.~~\r\n\r\nAnswer to my question: `t_Co` doesn't make sense because multiple TUIs can attach to a single nvim instance. `t_colors` should be removed and its uses should be replaced by `ui->term_colors`. This would require quite a bit of effort.\r\n",
