What do I mean by it ? \r\nI recently had a hang that seemed quite long. I could reproduce it , and do `profile start`  before it happens. However, in case the hang was infinite (which happened in other cases) , there is really no way to debug. Because you can't run `profile stop` and no file is generated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCould there be a command that generates a stream of function calls (something that I guess profile uses internally)  ? \r\nSo that if at certain point there is a freeze, you can see the last calls.\r\n\r\nThanks",
