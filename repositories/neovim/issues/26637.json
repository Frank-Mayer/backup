Let me know if you need screenshots.\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nInstall neovim stable 0.9.4\r\nInstall moonlight theme\r\nOpen your regular vim.opt. settings file, have a look\r\nUpgrade to neovim nightly and do the exact same thing again, you will find that the colors have changed.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor themes to work as intended.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1825+gd65c6a0ba Build type: RelWithDebInfo LuaJIT 2.1.1702233742 Run \"nvim -V1 -v\" for more info\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nI have not tested the same theme on regular vim.\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nwin Version\t10.0.19044 Build 19044\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nwindows terminal Version: 1.19.231010001-preview and Alacritty Version 0.12.3\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nmsi",
