This discrepancy result in incomplete screen restoration when exiting `neovim` within `tmux` if the screen was resized inside `neovim`. \n\n**Possible Solution**:\nIf `neovim` could account for the full buffer `tmux` holds (not just the visible portion), it might better handle cleanup and restore the terminal state consistently. I believe vim already does that, cause this doesn't happen with vim.\n\n**Environment**:\n- Only tested on WSL ( but I belive this would be same on actual linux distros too )\n- Happens consistently in tmux\n- Might affect other scroll-restricted environments\n\n**Screenshots**:\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fed511b-3252-477e-ae46-99d62720ba3e)\n\n> Let me know if you need any other info or want me to test something specific!\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Start a tmux session\n2. Have some terminal history (like 4-5 commands) above for better visibility\n3. Open neovim (can be either empty buffer or existing file)\n4. Resize the screen size (using ctrl-minus or equivalent zoom out)\n5. Fill the screen with content (even empty lines work)\n6. Exit neovim with :q!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n**Expected behavior**:\nNeovim should properly clean up the entire screen and restore the terminal state correctly, regardless of screen resize operations.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 8.2 ( only nvim failed even with `nvim -u DEFAULTS` )\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 ( WSL2 - Ubuntu )\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nSystem Package Manager (APT)",
