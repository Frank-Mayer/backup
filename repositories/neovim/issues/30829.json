I was wondering whether my plugins are causing that neovim became slow. But then I realized that the arrow down and up keys are as fast as ever. \n\nIs it only me? I did not really changed my configuration at all lately.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nopen any file\nstart navigating up and down with j and k\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe j and k keys should be acting fast.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nvi behaves all right\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 15.0.1\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niTerm2 3.5.5\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",
