    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nSwitched my computer (Debian (testing)) from using X11 to Wayland and shortly thereafter realised that I'd lost the ability to yank and paste to/from the * and + registers.\r\n\r\nAttempts gave the following error:\r\n```\r\n1 line yanked into \"*                                                                         \r\nclipboard: error invoking xclip: Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified  Error:\r\n Can't open display: :0 \r\nclipboard: error: Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecked `:help clipboard` which says neovim determines how to use those registers by checking the the `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` env var. Mine was set:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY \r\nwayland-0\r\n```\r\n\r\nA bit of quick digging on StackOverflow later led me to the fact that neovim uses `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` to enable the expected behaviour, thereupon I found out that I don't have those commands installed. A quick `apt install wl-clipboard` later and the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI looked at the code that figures out how to set the clipboard [here][1] and it's not only checking for `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, it's also checking whether or not `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` are installed which is fair enough, but that isn't exactly what's documented in the `:help`.\r\n\r\nA further read leads me to the condition I actually fell into (line 113) `elseif !empty($DISPLAY) && executable('xclip')`:\r\n```\r\n$ echo $DISPLAY \r\n:0\r\n$ type xsel\r\nbash: type: xsel: not found\r\n$ type xclip\r\nxclip is aliased to `xclip -selection clipboard'\r\n```\r\n\r\n... which explains why it was trying to call `xclip` and why I never got any error messages on startup as I might have expected.\r\n\r\nI think there's two problem:\r\n\r\n1. There's a documentation problem that the `:help` doesn't fully describe the checks that are actually done when figuring out which clipboard tool to use. I think this could be fixed fairly easily to give a more exact description.\r\n\r\n2. The logic in `provider#clipboard#Executable()` with respect to Wayland, and perhaps others, isn't robust enough. I'm not _au fait_ with vimscript, but maybe something like the following would be better:\r\n```\r\n[...]\r\n  elseif !empty($WAYLAND_DISPLAY) \r\n    if executable('wl-copy') && executable('wl-paste')\r\n      let s:copy['+'] = ['wl-copy', '--type', 'text/plain']\r\n      let s:paste['+'] = ['wl-paste', '--no-newline']\r\n      let s:copy['*'] = ['wl-copy', '--primary', '--type', 'text/plain']\r\n      let s:paste['*'] = ['wl-paste', '--no-newline', '--primary']\r\n      return 'wl-copy'\r\n    elseif executable('waycopy') && executable('waypaste')\r\n      let s:copy['+'] = ['waycopy', '-t', 'text/plain']\r\n      let s:paste['+'] = ['waypaste', '-t', 'text/plain']\r\n      let s:copy['*'] = s:copy['+']\r\n      let s:paste['*'] = s:paste['+']\r\n      return 'wayclip'\r\n    else\r\n      echohl WarningMsg\r\n      echomsg 'clipboard: error detecting clipboard tool. Wayland session detected, no wayland clipboard tools installed'\r\n      echohl None\r\n      return ''\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/53cc835b51546f9ff68facebab2e0c6e97585e5b/runtime/autoload/provider/clipboard.vim#L95\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Run under a Wayland Windows manager session ($WAYLAND_DISPLAY envvar should be non-empty)\r\n* Don't have the `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`, or `waycopy` and `waypaste` tools installed\r\n* Also have the $DISPLAY envvar non-empty\r\n* Have `xclip` installed (`xsel` might do funny things as well, no idea)\r\n* Try to yank anything into the * or + registers\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNeovim should correctly detect the error condition of running a Wayland session without the correct Wayland Clipboard tools installed and notify the user of the error.\r\n\r\nIt should not be able to fall through to another apparently correct set of clipboard boards which do not work.\r\n\r\nThe documentation should be more exact in describing how the clipboard functionality is determined to enable a faster user self-diagnostic and repair.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.7.2\r\n\r\nAlso found in 0.9.4 (AppImage)\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nmaybe, didn't fully test but on yank it does emit a similar error message.
