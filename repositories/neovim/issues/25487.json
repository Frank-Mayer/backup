Before setting all my tooling up I upgraded to macOS sonoma.\r\n\r\nHowever, when cloning my config and running NeoVim I get this error when using `noice.nvim`:\r\n```\r\ndlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, syn_attr2entry): symbol not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nI do think this is an issue with NeoVim itself as this seems to be related to a LuaJIT issue rather than how the plugin does things.\r\n\r\nVersions between the M1 MacBook and M2 Pro one match fully within homebrew.\r\n\r\nI do apologize if I falsely opened this report and it is not related to NeoVim or a classic user error. I do hope to get pointers in the right direction nonetheless. :)\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```bash\r\n# Start with a fresh install of macOS Sonoma\r\n# Install homebrew\r\nbrew install neovim\r\n# Create minimal config that uses Packer and noice.nvim (or any other script that tries running the aforementioned FFI call)\r\nnvim\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should not throw any errors.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.2 Release (LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 9.0 (the one Mac comes with)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14 Sonoma\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\niterm2 3.4.20\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nhomebrew",
