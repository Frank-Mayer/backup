    "body": "We can set tw=80 for instance, for hardwrap however editing the line in middle will increase the total length of the line beyond 80 characters, in fact it is possible to get arbitrarily long lines this way. This is extremely uncomfortable since many commands will no longer work as intended like go to end beginning of line.  I imagine this is less of a problem for code, but for something like latex, markdown it is a huge problem. I think something like fo+=a is meant to partially address this but it only make sense for plain text (if that). In latex, markdown there are commands that like to be on their own line and fo+=a will mess with that.\n\nEdit:\nHere is a more explicit summary: 1) Give an option to make hardwrap at tw=X behave **visually** as  softwrap at tw=X, although the latter does not exist yet, it can be simulated with a plugin like Goyo for example.\n2) Or what would be sufficient  and probably much easier to implement is to give an option so that all commands which have to do with lines, work with visual lines. Commands like D, dd, go to end of line, etc. \n",
