    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI have been looking over Neovim configurations and to say that the plugin system is a mess would be an understatement.  It would be nice if there was a standard plugin file structure that EVERY plugin followed.  Just look at the hundreds of videos of people configuring Neovim.  Half the plugins have configuration examples that only serve to confuse the new user.  I think Neovim is a fine editor but it could be so much more and much more accessible for new users.  Yes I understand it is a huge task but I can't even count how many different directory structures and config file \"examples\" there are.  Maybe the goal for version 1.0 would be a better way.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSuggest a Neovim standard configuration folder structure that is recommended.  Provide complete examples to get many of the top 25 or 30 plugins running at least being able to run under say Lazy.vim.  Plugin authors would at least follow the \"core\" configuration to get a running system.  Yes custom stuff would still be available but at least a new user could follow some complete documentation with real world working example configuration files to get a plugin working and modify it from there.\r\n\r\nToo much to ask?",

I don't think I have seen anything peculiar when it comes to directory structure.\r\n\r\nOther than this folder structure, when it comes to how to structure and separate (lua) modules and all the codes, design choice should be left to individual plugin, rather than being too restrictive. What would be benefits of doing so? It would be plugin authors' freedom to do whatever that is reasonable.",
