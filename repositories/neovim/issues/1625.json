    "body": "#1605 paves the way for a completely refactored UI and this means Neovim is getting close to its first release. I'm opening this issue to draw a line for which tasks must be performed before Neovim becomes beta.\n#1605 exposes a new UI API based on the ideas of how Vim GUI is implemented: A custom termcap parser that is fed with data passed to ui_write(which normally simply writes to the screen) and calls UI update functions in ui.c. This scenario is hacky and far from ideal(in essence Nvim is parsing its own output), but it will let us do the migration in smaller steps, especially because #1605 introduces a nice way of testing screen state.\n\nWith that said, here's what I have planned for the first release:\n- [x] Merge #1605\n- [x] Add more screen tests\n- [x] Refactor the builtin terminal UI for the new UI architecture. The new TUI is based on [unibilium](https://github.com/mauke/unibilium) and [libtermkey](http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtermkey/)\n- [x] Remove term.c, term.h and term_defs.h and replace all calls to out_str that output terminal codes by direct calls to ui.c functions. This will remove the termcap hack introduced in #1605 \n- [ ] Add a new implementation of the UI layer based on a GUI toolkit. I still haven't chosen a GUI library so suggestions are welcome as long as the library meets these requirements: \n  - is implemented in pure C\n  - is very lightweight, Nvim doesn't need advanced GUI features, just enough to implement a RGB terminal-like grid.\n  - is cross platform(windows/unix)\n- [x] Implement an alternative way of handling commands that require a terminal(#1496/#1528). Fixed by #2076.\n- [ ] Make the necessary changes to build/run on Windows(@equalsraf seems to have done a lot of the work already)\n\nNote that even though libtermkey is incompatible with Windows, we are still going to use it for Neovim. The reason is simple: Windows console is a pain and there's no need to maintain a terminal version  that is windows-compatible because no one will ever use it.\n\nIf anyone remembers something critical that should be added to the above list just let me know\n",

Can you tell us shortly how they relate, what their function is and why they're better for our purpose?\n\nThumbs up for libvterm, from the description it sounds like it's exactly what we need.\n\n> Add a new implementation of the UI layer based on a GUI toolkit. I still haven't chosen a GUI library so suggestions are welcome as long as the library meets these requirements:\n\nDo you mean something like GTK+? I don't really see what that's necessary, it could be supplied by a third party. As for me, I'd like to keep using nvim inside of a terminal.\n\n**EDIT**: I'm really not sure we should be calling it Neovim 1.0 quite so quickly. We all know that the intense internal refactoring has resulted in a lot of bugs, which is entirely normal. The way I see it right now we are in alpha, which makes us very flexible and makes users less angry when we break things, which we do. I'd be in favour of moving into beta territory after the list you presented makes it. But I'm not sure I'd want to marry with the first implementation of some of these things or attach our name to a 1.0 release without knowing damn well we are ready to stick by our guns at the API level and think we can provide a user experience with less bugs/surprises (esp. vis-a-vis vanilla Vim).\n",

We will simply assume that the UI can do tasks like \"scroll rectangle x, x', y, y'\" and call the appropriate method. The UI layer should find the most efficient way perform the mirroring.\n\n> I'm really not sure we should be calling it Neovim 1.0 quite so quickly. We all know that the intense internal refactoring has resulted in a lot of bugs, which is entirely normal. The way I see it right now we are in alpha, which makes us very flexible and makes users less angry when we break things, which we do. I'd be in favour of moving into beta territory after the list you presented makes it. But I'm not sure I'd want to marry with the first implementation of some of these things or attach our name to a 1.0 release without knowing damn well we are ready to stick by our guns at the API level and think we can provide a user experience with less bugs/surprises (esp. vis-a-vis vanilla Vim).\n\nThats what I meant by \"frozen\", I have updated the issue to be more clear about this\n",

If you want lua plugins via msgpack-rpc, it should be very easy to implement on top of [lua-client](https://github.com/neovim/lua-client), all it needs is connectivity via stdin/stdout. \n\nUnfortunately I'm short on time so I have to focus on the release. After that I will give some priority to plugins in other languages: I plan to implement a C library(libnvimclient) which can be used with any language that has a C bridge. This library will contain all the complexity of a msgpack-rpc client and will be shared for all languages.\n\n> +1 for using SDL for the GUI. If you really want to change from ncurses (which seems like a HUGE piece of work), check out Termbox.\n\nNvim doesn't use ncurses, just direct calls to <termios.h> and termcap queries with `tgetent`. I've already considered many options including termbox, but decided for libtickit for these reasons:\n- Easy integration with programs that have their own event loop.(Maybe I missed but I couldn't find a way to integrate termbox with another event loop)\n- Through libtermkey, libtickit has a unique key parsing scheme that is also backwards compatible: http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms/ .\n- Very clean/intuitive API/implementation. It is easy to hack the source code if necessary.\n- Very well documented. Both libtermkey and libtickit have a complete set of manpages\n\n> Another possible gui candidate is: https://pwmt.org/projects/girara/\n> Which is a wrapper around gtk+ and provides a vim like setup (main window, status bar etc.)\n\nI want to keep nvim a text-only program, so graphical widgets such as  toolbars/buttons are not going to be part of the GUI. Other rich GUIs can be easily developed by third party projects\n",

Not a great difference, but it will be useful for many plugins, like Syntastic, Nerdtree and any new plugins. The plugins will be received like they're grown-ups, instead hacky ones. If Vim detect there is no GUI running, then there are no icons showed.

Would implementing it as a stand-alone referencing client benefit those who want to focus on the GUI implementation for creating thirdy-party GUI client. Or in other words, would it be an appropriate time point for decoupling the Neovim core from GUI client components.\n\nGUI and TUI will live in the main repo but the separation of UI/core code will be clear. Theres little gain in putting them on separate repositories, especially because the UI code should be simple enough.\n\n> As for the choice of \"UI toolkit\" (scarequotes because of the rather simplicistic requirements that forego the widgets UI toolkits provide), why not cairo and supplementary libraries like pango to render text? That would probably involve less complexity than with SDL and be similiarly portable.\n\nI haven't decided to use SDL yet, I will use whatever toolkit makes simple drawing/updating monospace font grids\n\n> Windows console is a pain now I agree, but what if it becomes bearable in newer versions of windows ?

Maintaining something like that will require considerable effort, and that for something that almost no one will use. The only way Nvim will support a windows console UI is if libtickit adds support without changing the public API.\n",

Windows (since Windows 7 at least) actually has some subset of unix \"pipe\" functionality. I use it to pipe things like `grep foo | vim -`. If this launches the Nvim GUI, that's perfectly fine. \n2. Opening files from the command line. It's also fine for this to launch the GUI, and with Nvim's API we can even focus an existing GUI.\n3. It opens in the same position and dimensions of the console window. If we could position the Nvim GUI over the console window, that would avoid the discomfort of launching a new window.\n\n> Thats what I meant by \"frozen\", I have updated the issue to be more clear about this\n\n@tarruda I'm still confused by the title of this thread. We don't need to be version 1.0 for the \"first release\". It is totally acceptable for the first release to be a beta. We need 10x more feedback from users and plugin authors before freezing the API. \n\n> Fix handling of shell commands(#1496/#1528) to work with programs that require a tty\n\nWould it be possible, instead, to suspend or background `nvim`, to allow the _actual terminal_ to run the interactive program, and then, after the program exists, make some API call to `nvim` to restore it?\n\n> If anyone remembers something critical that should be added to the above list just let me know\n\nMost of the issues in the [first release milestone](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22first+release%22) are important, I think.\n",

I use it to pipe things like grep foo | vim -. If this launches the Nvim GUI, that's perfectly fine.\n> Opening files from the command line. It's also fine for this to launch the GUI, and with Nvim's API we can even focus an existing GUI.\n> It opens in the same position and dimensions of the console window. If we could position the Nvim GUI over the console window, that would avoid the discomfort of launching a new window.\n\nNvim will be launchable by the windows console, and just like any other windows graphical program it will open a new window. I cannot say if it will open in the same position/dimensions of the console window(if this is something easy to implement, I don't see why not). Reading data from stdin will also be supported.\n\n> @tarruda I'm still confused by the title of this thread. We don't need to be version 1.0 for the \"first release\".  It is totally acceptable for the first release to be a beta.\n\n1.0 is just a version name, I don't mind if we call it 0.0.1 or something else..\n\n> We need 10x more feedback from users and plugin authors before freezing the API.\n\nYes, the API will be constantly improving. But we need to draw a line somewhere in order to make a stable release. By frozen I meant that I will create a separate branch(eg: first-release), stop merging big refactorings, new features or changes that have a high risk of causing breakage, and focus on making this branch stable to make an official release.\n",

Zsh is far less likely to crash due to some plugin or upstream bug then *Vim, so you are guaranteed to have your history with :suspend without any mixings or additional steps (zsh has useful features like SHARE_HISTORY and INC_APPEND_HISTORY, with the latter you have your history in case of crash, but it will be mixed with other shells' history).\n\nI also sometimes relaunch Vim due to e.g. plugin update. Not sure whether SIGHUP handler is able to dump history in zsh (without the aforementioned options enabled) or whatever your favourite shell is. Pretty sure cmd.exe does not bother (does it keep history at all?), dunno about PowerShell.\n\nI am hoping such changes as dropping :suspend or terminal version altogether will not touch *nix terminal version.\n",
