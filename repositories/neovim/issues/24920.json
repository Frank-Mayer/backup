If they're implemented in the naive way, to just repeat the commands input by the user there might be some ways to optimize them:\r\n\r\n1. Eliminate no-ops. For example, repeated esc, j followed by a k, etc.\r\n2. A macro compiler that turns macros into the native movements or something like that. Resolve what the movements will be ahead of time instead of having to pass through the whole input decoding and mapping (I've no idea how vim works)\r\n",
