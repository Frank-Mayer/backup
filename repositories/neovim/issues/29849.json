The same is true for `preview` buffer.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIdeally this would highlight the popup with the documentation format that the language server provides. Seems like the spec sais there a `documentationFormat` field that is set: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocument_completion.",
