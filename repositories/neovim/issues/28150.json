They need not appear at the start of the `{lhs}`. Not sure if this is intended, but the error is not raised from e.g. `:map`, only from abbreviation commands as far as I can tell (e.g. `:iabbrev`). Further requirements are that the lhs must contain **at least 2** characters not in the offending set. `:iabbrev #i #include` works, but not `:iabbrev #ii #include`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAbbreviations with arbitrary `{lhs}` excluding `|` work as before.\r\n\r\nThis vim issue from 2018 looks similar: https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/2810, however it isn't the same. I can't do `:iabbrev @ii @include` even with `@` being present in my `&iskeyword`.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.9.5\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nyes, 9.1 through patch 250\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nlinux x86_64 glibc\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nalacritty 0.13.2\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nalacritty\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nxbps (Void system package manager)",

This is the most common\r\n\t  abbreviation.\r\n\r\n\t  Examples: \"foo\", \"g3\", \"-1\"\r\n\r\nend-id\t  The \"end-id\" type ends in a keyword character, but all the other\r\n\t  characters are not keyword characters.\r\n\r\n\t  Examples: \"#i\", \"..f\", \"$/7\"\r\n\r\nnon-id\t  The \"non-id\" type ends in a non-keyword character, the other\r\n\t  characters may be of any type, excluding space and tab.\r\n\r\n\t  Examples: \"def#\", \"4/7$\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this is working as intended.",
