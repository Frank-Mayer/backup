    "body": "### Problem\n\nI operate on a Windows system with multiple drives and actively control the installation location of software based on my personal criteria. When I opted for a custom install using the .msi file and specified my desired location, I had expected Neovim to be fully installed at the target location and not have any activity on my other drives. I was rather bothered by discovering its additional presence on my operating system drive and was not informed on the usage of Standard Paths during the installation procedure. It is my view that installed software with a specified installation directory should not have components installed in unspecified locations without the user's knowledge during the installation process.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nUser should be notified about the usage of Standard Paths and/or be allowed to specify/manipulate the location of the standard paths.",
