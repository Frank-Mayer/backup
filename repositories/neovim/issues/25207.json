When I opted for a custom install using the .msi file and specified my desired location, I had expected Neovim to be fully installed at the target location and not have any activity on my other drives. I was rather bothered by discovering its additional presence on my operating system drive and was not informed on the usage of [Standard Paths](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#standard-path) during the installation procedure. It is my view that installed software with a specified installation directory should not have components installed in unspecified locations without the user's knowledge during the installation process.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nUser should be notified about the usage of [Standard Paths](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#standard-path) and/or be allowed to specify/manipulate the location of the standard paths during the installation process.",
