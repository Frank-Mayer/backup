Open a file with `nvim -i NONE file.txt`\r\n2. `:Ex` to open netrw's file explorer\r\n3. `Ctrl+O` to go back to the file\r\n4. `:jumps` to see that the jumplist is fine\r\n5. `Ctrl+I` to go back to the netrw's file explorer\r\n6. `:jumps` now the current jump show as `-invalid-`\r\n7. `Ctrl+O` to go back to the file\r\n8. `Ctrl+I` to go back to netrw's file explorer then errors `E19: Mark has invalid line number`\r\n9. `:jumps` -> you can see that the line has changed\r\n\r\nOn Vim if you check `:jumps` after step 7 the `-invalid-` jump won't be on the list.",
