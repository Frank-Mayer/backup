    "body": "### Problem\n\nI failed to find a way a native lsp feature to scroll docs. Apparently you have to enter the docs by pressing the same keymap twice, then scroll normally, and then you also have to jump out of the floating window. I don't like it, because it forces me to use additional keymaps when I just want to scroll down the docs once or twice. I saw someone mentioned that the coc.nvim plugin does have this feature. And from what I've read it jumps into the floating window, scrolls and then jump out of it. Although, when I used it I didn't notice anything like that â€” it just scrolls, and I loved it. At least `<c-f>` and `<c-b>` worked, and this was enough for me (at least from what I can remember). If a user wants to copy something from the docs, then the double keymap press to hop into it can still be used. I also didn't find how to scroll docs when using nvim-cmp, I only know that I can scroll it up and down with Lua API (autocompletion docs in insert mode), but it doesn't work for Neovim's LSP hover docs window.\r\n\r\nRelated links:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15092\r\nhttps://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp/issues/1410\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe feature can be implemented in 2 ways, I suppose:\r\n1. add a scroll function that would do \"jump in, scroll, jump out\" action\r\n2. add a proper docs scroll for a floating window without entering it\r\n\r\nThe first one should be much easier. The second probably would require quite a bit of discussion about which windows can be scrolled this way and the API.\r\n\r\nI haven't used VS Code in a long time, but I bet you can scroll in the floating windows there, when you hover over something. I think this feature is essential for the DX, and I am constantly reminded that it doesn't exist when I want to use it.",

It's not specific to LSP hover but scrolling floating windows in general. This could be a part of #25514 if we wanted to include that into Nvim core.\r\n\r\nOne workaround that you can use even currently is to use mouse: scrolling the wheels when the mouse pointer is over the floating window will make the (floating) window scrolled.",

A general solution that can be obviously used for non-hover-docs stuff. Though a dedicated `vim.lsp.buf.scroll_docs(number)` would be super convenient. It probably will include some additional logic, like automatically using the docs window that appeared after the call of `vim.lsp.buf.hover()`.\r\n\r\n> One workaround that you can use even currently is to use mouse\r\n\r\nThis workaround only works if I use a mouse, and I don't use a mouse. I use touchpad, but even it I use very rarely. Also, IMO, using mouse to scroll in docs window is probably slower than going into the docs window with an additional keymap (then scrolling with keymaps) and jumping out of it after with another keymap.",
