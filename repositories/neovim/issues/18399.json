Neovim is doing _something_ to configure the cursor color, because if I make my cursor red in the iTerm2 preferences then it appears red in my shell, but turns white when I open Neovim. I think https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6591 is related or tracks the bug if this is a bug. But anyway I cannot control my cursor color at all AFAICT.\r\n- Is there a simple way of retrieving (from Lua) the current highlight applied to the current cursor in the current window? For example, if you `:set winhighlight=Normal:Cursor` and then `:hi Normal`, you see the definition/values of the `Normal` HL group, not the `Cursor` group -- not sure if this is as intended.\r\n- Is there a simple way to query the HL group of the cursor from the test code? I looked at `cursor_spec.lua` a little bit but nothing jumped out at me.\r\n\r\nI could probably make this bug go away with a small diff in the C code but I think some of the above should get resolved first.",
