Linking against lpeg during runtime fails, because CMake looks for an `.dll.a` file and ignores all `.dll` files, which is easily fixable (see msys2/MINGW-packages#6394)\r\n2. Loading `lpeg` during runtime is however not easily fixable. Since Windows requires a `dll` to lie within `PATH`, and Lua modules are not installed into the `PATH` (since they are normally loaded directly via Lua), my patch loads the `dll` via invoking the Lua `package.loadlib` functionality from C.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed discussion about potential solutions, see msys2/MINGW-packages#21313\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nClone msys2/MINGW-packages and try to build neovim with version set to 0.10.1 using `makepkg`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCompiling under MinGW should work like a charm.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.0 and 0.10.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 10\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nN/A\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nN/A\n\n### Installation\n\npacman MSYS/MinGW",
