Most Linux Shells use a backslash (`\\`), Powershell uses a backtick (`` ` ``) and Windows CMD uses a circumflex (`^`) as escape character. The reason I said there's no mechanism on Windows is, that contrary to Linux environments, Neovim doesn't use a terminfo library on Windows to look at those overrides. So even if you put an override file in the same place on Windows as you would on Linux, it just won't be read.",
