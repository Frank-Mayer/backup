Hightlight is limited to language keywords (boldface \"if\", \"then\" for example), and green colored string.  No other highlighting visible.    Same happens when I get rid of my initial config file, i.e. run with vanilla nvim.  Thanks.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCompare versions above.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNot sure.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n64a14026d76ba1798d91e15a941fcb6af7cbc5ad\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nhave not tried\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nlinux centos\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nxterm with tmux and without\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nscreen-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",
