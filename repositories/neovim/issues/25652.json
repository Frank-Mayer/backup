Was this a recent change? How do I make the data dirs (as well as the undofile) stay what it was before?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen a file with \"set undofile\" set. Observe that the path for saving undo files is no longer what it was.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe undodir not having changed\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.9.4\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nunknown\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\n12.6.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\niTerm 3.4.18\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nhomebrew",
