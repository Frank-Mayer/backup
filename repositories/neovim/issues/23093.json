I came up with a function to disconnect all remote-ui sessions:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n  vim.keymap.set('n', '<leader>q', function()\r\n    for _, ui in pairs(vim.api.nvim_list_uis()) do\r\n      if ui.chan and not ui.stdout_tty then\r\n        vim.fn.chanclose(ui.chan)\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n  end, { noremap = true })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is working for my use case, but I am not 100% sure that ui.stdout_tty is the correct condition to check. But, if I use your nohup commands in combination with this I can have a long living neovim session. Hopefully this helps someone ðŸ™‚",
