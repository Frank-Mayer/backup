    "body": "While rebasing #810 I came across the new check for libuv's `uv_translate_sys_error()` used in [os/fs.c](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/5f1a153831d480180b2203120cff776d771ec1a4/src/nvim/os/fs.c#L400). The check succeeds and the code works with gcc/mingw however it seems the function is internal to libuv, definitely not part of the libuv headers.\n\nMaybe the symbol is accidentally exported in the libuv library and gcc is too permissive, but MSVC will not build with a reference error. Its also not the first time the CMake's function check has behaved differently in Windows, although in this case I consider MSVC is doing the right thing.\n\nUpstream issue  https://github.com/libuv/libuv/issues/79 that proposes exposing the API\n\nHow exactly should we address this\n1. Import the libuv code for uv_translate_sys_error(), the function itself is fairly simple. And given our current use the possibility breakage seems low - or at least lower than the alternative\n2. Wait for (or rather push) upstream\n3. Is there anything we should be doing in CI to detect this? compiler flags, etc\n",

Although it's not exposed in the headers, the CMake check is probably testing linking, which will work since it doesn't have hidden visibility.  Also, remember that C will assume a function returning int if it can't find a declaration, which is what uv_translate_sys_error does.\n",
