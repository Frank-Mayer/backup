On gitter and IRC people ask the same questions over and over.\n\nI suggest introducing `runtime/doc/nvim-faq.txt` (and maybe try keeping it synchronized with a similar wiki page).\n\nThe FAQ should be about the _now_. I think of it as a means to get new users quickly up to terms. It would include things like..\n- Why does this Ruby plugin not work?\n- Why doesn't `<c-h>` work?\n- How to get Neovim to resize my window? (#3048)\n- How do you manage your plugins?\n\nYour opinions? If you agree, I'd whip up a first draft.\n\n(BTW, on IRC @kevinburke suggested something similar today.)\n",
