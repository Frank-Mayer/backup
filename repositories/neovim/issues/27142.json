What happens is, when you run \"devpod up\" the container is created and you are told to do \"ssh yourworkscape.devpod\". It turns out DevPod change your ~/.ssh/config and this ssh command is actualy a ProxyCommand in your ~/.ssh/config like this: \"ProxyCommand devpod ssh --stdio --context default --user dev yourworkspace\".\r\n\r\nThe thing is, no matter what I change inside the container, accessing it with this command always break Neovim/Astronvim UI.\r\n\r\nSo, at the end. I came with two workaround for this:\r\n1. wrap your session with Tmux or Screen and run neovim (after you enter the container with ssh as being told by devpod)\r\n2. access your container with docker ie: docker container exec -it containername bash, and run neovim\r\n\r\nBoth approach works perfectly, but its still a bit annoying :)\r\n\r\n",
