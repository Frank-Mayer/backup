Would be great if they would be, so they could be read at runtime. (right now I generate them separately and then include them in the plugin)~~\r\n  - no longer needed for my usage\r\n* ~~is something similar possible for the vim functions? `vim.fn`?~~\r\n  - for now I use the data from `vim-lsp` which is sufficient for my use-case\r\n* the current LUA runtime includes some LUA annotations already, like `@param` and `@return`, but the types are missing. Would you be willing to accept a PR that adds proper types for these methods? (Like `vim.treesitter.get_parser()` returns a `vim.treesitter.LanguageTree`. With those annotations, then users get completion on the parser as well) ",
