You must remove `main.shada`, rename most recent of the temporary files to `main.shada`, remove other temporary files and solve the issue that caused generation of temporary files.",

It appears most of them are treesitter highlighter errors. On this note, is there a good way to purge the log file? should I just delete the contents and let it start writing to an empty file? thanks.",

For me it seems to be when I have multiple instances of Neovim open in different terminal tabs. For example I often have my nvim config cwd open in neovim to tweak my plugins / config stuff as well as my Obsidian vault cwd for notes and then often the project / code I am working on. Having 2 or 3 instances of nvim running each in their own cwd is pretty common for me and it seems that when I am more actively switching between the 2 or 3 instances and \"doing stuff\" in each of them, that seems to be when my shada temp files fill-up (A-Z).\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.",

My assumption is they should be \"cleaning themselves up\" once nvim processes are released\r\n> \r\n> That's where (in theory) the logic could be smarter. It would require Nvim to scan all the tmp files and check if other Nvim processes are using them, then merge them somehow.\r\n> \r\n> But that's pretty clumsy (another hack on top of the existing hack), I hope we can find a simpler and more reliable approach.\r\n\r\nCool. Thanks for the transparency. Makes sense. So basically you are saying \"the whole process is a bit fragile as it is, so it is not surprising there are issues like this. But instead of putting a bandaid approach which will just make things more fragile, a new approach should be determined that will make the entire process/feature more reliable.\" Is that fair enough interpretation?\r\n\r\nAlso happy to provide testing or to have ideas bounced off me if that would help down the road. Just let me know and keep me posted. I track my \"subscribed to\" issues fairly frequently so any updates that come here I will see.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and efforts as always!",

But it is probably appropriate to share it here since this issue is still active.\n\nComment link here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/30872#issuecomment-2439420120\n\nHere is the content:\n\nJust commenting here as an fyi as it was something I finally tracked down earlier today (potential hunch) and it also seemed to relate to swap / shada files (and I saw other reports of similar hunches online). That is that sometimes when I quit neovim with `:qa` it exits to my terminal but the screen stays \"painted\" with the neovim buffers I had on screen last and I have to do a \"clear\" in my terminal.\n\nToday I finally got some ideas on it and in my testing it happened most often when:\n\n1. Had shada tmp files full.\n2. Interestingly enough my main shada file got pretty large (500kb) and stopped updating even after I cleared the temp files out.\n3. This is more subjective, but it seemed to happen more often when using a loaded mini.session (plugin) saved session which has a \"auto write / save session on exit\" feature.\n\nIt seems like this could be related as when I deleted my main shada file that was growing larger and seemed \"stuck\", it stopped happening (nvim staying rendered / painted after quit) for the time being.\n\nFor mini.sessions it could make sense based on the details in this PR that something is happening \"weirdly\" during quit when the sessions are getting auto saves. I presume it is hooking into events during exit, and from the sounds of this PR, that could definitely be relevant here and explain some of my \"problems\".",
