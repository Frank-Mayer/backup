I need this as I want to transform netrw scp URIs to local paths before I issue a request to the LSP server, as the LSP server is running on stdin/stdout over ssh on a remote server.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI should be able to hook into all inbound and outbound requests. I think this facilitation would allow for a very thin plugin that gets a pretty native \"vscode remote\" like functionality. An alternative route I will be taking if this is not so easy, is to just have a proxy language server that is _neovim aware_.",
