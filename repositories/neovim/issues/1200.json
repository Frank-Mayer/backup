There isn't much logic associated with it, but we should make a ticket to restore it using libuv.\r\n\r\nSo, the plan is that anyone interested takes a look at the vanilla Vim source and see if anything from libuv matches. Report back here with a plan and/or submit a pull request with the changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
