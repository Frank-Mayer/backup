    "body": "- `nvim --version`: VIM v0.2.1-272-gfe476ed (on https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/6816 to fix scrolling problems on master), but I do not remember not having this problem\r\n- Vim (version: ) behaves differently? could not check, no vim available\r\n- Operating system/version: Kubuntu 16.10\r\n- Terminal name/version: Alacritty / rxvt-unicode / konsole\r\n- `$TERM`: xterm-256color\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nWhen a big file is opened and modified for a long time, the scrolling gets laggier and laggier. I tried to narrow it down to a plugin / action (over the course of a few months), but in the end what \"solves\" it is switching to `norelativenumber`.\r\n\r\nI tried to profile the script times (with `profile func / file *`) but nothing seems out of place. Syntax parsing is not especially slow. There aren't any autocommands on `CursorMoved` but for [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake), [airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) and [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic), but disabling those plugins did not help.\r\n\r\nTo sum it up, I open some big file and work on it for a long time, and scrolling is getting laggier and laggier over time. I noticed that the more folds are opened, the laggier it gets. Also, it is \"per buffer\" (a newly opened buffer will not have the problem unless I spend a long time on it). Finally, `set norelativenumber` instantly solves the problem. Setting `relativenumber` back will make it as laggy as before I disabled it.\r\n\r\nOnce the lagging is noticeable, I tried switching the filetype to no avail (to remove the possibility of bad syntax file), disabling all plugins that can be dynamically disabled, but in the end `set norelativedelta` is the trigger.\r\n\r\nAlso (to be clear), the \"lag\" is actually my CPU running 100%, and it also happens in insert mode, though the easiest and most annoying proof is scrolling.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nNot such a huge performance difference between `relativenumber` and `norelativenumber`\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\n**Edit :** I understand there may not be enough information to solve this, and I can live without `relativenumber`. I will try to narrow it down by trimming my init.vim but this may take some days / weeks\r\n\r\n**Edit 2 :** Finally narrowed down the cause of the problem, it was the [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine) (detailed report [here](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine/issues/58#issuecomment-314718710)). I do not really understand how I missed it since it never appeared in any report (syntime / profile), but removing it totally solved it (though there still is a difference between using `set relativenumber` and `set norelativenumber`)",
