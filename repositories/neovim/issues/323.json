Also, I thought you wanted to use every C99 feature? :) One reason for avoiding VLAs: http://www.clarkcox.com/blog/2009/04/07/c99s-vlas-are-evil/\n\n> When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the standard line length, keep operators at the start of the line\n\nGlad to see this, but it will probably be controversial.\n\nAnother thing: some people like to align assignments, etc, like this:\n\n```\nint a         = 0;\nint long_name = b;\n```\n\nI don't care one way or the other, but I do think it introduces extra churn and complicates the blame, when a new assignment is added/removed, and the entire block is re-aligned.\n",

Here are some of my comments and questions:\n\n**Doxygen**\n\nI am also in favor of switching to `//` for comments in general and using `///` with `@annotation` for Doxygen.\n\n**Aligning variable assignments**\n\nI agree with @justinmk that we should disallow this due to the code churn it causes.\n\n**Keeping logical operators at the beginning of the line when splitting**\n\nI personally prefer keeping them at the end of the line because to me, it is easier to read with the terms of the expressions lined up, but since the Google style guide says that either is fine and since the Vim codebase has more instances of keeping them at the beginning, let's go with that.\n\n**Don't use MACRO_STYLE_NAMES for enumerators**\n\nYes please. :) Glad to see this.\n\n**Macros vs Inline functions**\n\nI noticed you removed the section on inline functions. There are currently a significant number of macros. Are we allowing macros then?\n\n**The #define Guard**\n\nFor header files in subdirectories, I think the `#define` guard should contain the subdirectory name as well since it is possible for a header file in a subdirectory to have the same file name as a different header file in another directory. For example, if we decide to move the ex-specific files under an `ex` subdirectory, then the header guard for `ex/eval.h` would be `#define NEOVIM_EX_EVAL_H`.\n",

This is not the case in C. In that sense `inline` in C++ is much closer to macros.\n\n> For header files in subdirectories\n\nI didn't realize that we had those. I'll fix it.\n",

If there is a bitflag variable where the highest flag is at 25 bit it does not really matter whether it will be represented using 32-bit, 64-bit or whatever integer, so the compiler can do more optimizations.

I like that it removes the duplication, and it's even less redundant than a for-loop.  Though a for-loop reads better to me:\n\n```\nfor (x = f(); x != A; x = f()) {\n    ...\n}\n```\n\nIn the end, I don't think we should focus on getting the density so up that we lose readability.  As a person who has spent the last 13 years of their life as a consultant and reading other people's code (and lots of it), I still dislike the assignment in the conditional.\n\nBut, my opinion isn't the only one that counts here. :-)\n",

To keep everything consistent we demand separate declarations and definitions.\n\nNo offense, but I still think it's unnecessary redundancy.  There's no reason you can put the doc string with the static function definition.  I think only public functions should have it elsewhere--in the header, where other devs are more likely to read it.  I think the inconsistency is worth removing the redundancy, IMHO.\n\nI have to admit I'm not fan of banning the use of `/* ... */` style comments either, nor preferring the `//` and `///` style comments.  The `/* ... */` and `/** ... */` style for comments makes wrapping much easier if you need to reflow a paragraph--as long as you leave of the leading `*` on the lines.\n\nAll that said, I'm glad you and others are spending time trying to work out the details.  In the end, it will make for a much cleaner code base (assuming we stick to it).\n\nOne small pet peeve: coding standards often seem like a license to nitpick.

I don't think you need a separate declaration and documentation just to have consistency with the public functions.  If you guys want it, and think it's a great idea, then great.

Use tabs for _indentation_ and spaces for _alignment_. This way developers can set their own tab widths **and** guarantee consistent alignment, the best of both worlds :smile:\n\nHere's an example using GNU's alignment style and this kind of indentation:\n\n``` c\nint main (int argc, char** argv) {\n    mode = ((inmode[j] == VOIDmode\n             || (GET_MODE_SIZE (outmode[j]) > GET_MODE_SIZE (inmode[j])))\n            ? outmode[j] : inmode[j]);\n}\n```\n\nLines 2, 3, and 4 are indented with one tab each since they are at the 1st indentation level, and lines 3 and 4 further aligned with spaces.\n\nEDIT: misread @mahkoh's post :tongue: and edited to make more sense\n",

Personally I prefer C++ comments, but only if it's possible to convert the old comments automatically. If not let's stick to C comments.\n",
