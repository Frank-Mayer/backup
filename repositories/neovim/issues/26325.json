    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI have run into a problem with highlighting in `InspectTree` caused by `ts_match_limit` being \"only\" 256. \r\n\r\nThe bug shows up when I highlight the tree based on the nesting level and the branch contains a large subtree.  \r\n\r\n<img width=\"407\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-30 at 14 50 34\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7075380/72d3f312-9c12-4414-a6cd-24c75749b366\">\r\n\r\nI tried to build with no change to the code other than\r\n```diff\r\n- ts_query_cursor_set_match_limit(cursor, 256);\r\n+ ts_query_cursor_set_match_limit(cursor, 1024);\r\n```\r\nin `neovim/src/nvim/lua/treesitter.c` and that fixes the issue:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"415\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-30 at 14 53 42\" src=\"https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/7075380/b2e39fb9-7484-4a55-bafe-fa4ce4816e03\">\r\n\r\nNote: This is mainly a problem in the languages that build a tree all within some top level node. E.g. the pictures are from the `README.md` of neovim, where the whole tree is inside a top level `section`. \r\n\r\n(Thank you @lucario387 for helping me figure out what causes the bug.)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI think this is already a known issue, see:\r\n- #22055\r\n- #22497\r\n\r\nI can include exact steps of reproduction if you want? But I already narrowed down the exact line of code causing this above, so I don't think it should be necessary?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI can see in the discussion in #22055 that `ts_match_limit` is set relatively low for performance reasons, so I am not sure if simply raising the limit again is a good solution.\r\n\r\nIn #22055 it was mentioned that it might be better to set a timeout for the query itself and raise the limit, so maybe that is the best solution?\r\n\r\nEither way I am mainly creating this issue to have an open issue about finding a solution to this, since #22055 is closed. \r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1721+g01b91deec-Homebrew\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.1.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nwezterm 20231030-074559-75909682\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\ntested repo and homebrew",
