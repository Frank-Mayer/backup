    "body": "First of all, I appreciate the huge efforts and work done in the new default colorscheme #26334, it's a great feature and nice enhancement of neovim.\r\n\r\nI hope this can be a follow-up thread as a part of the tracking issue #26369, about the awesome new default colorscheme introduced in #26334. Initiated from [my reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/189nw6r/comment/kbvd65x/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3):\r\n\r\n## Description of the problem\r\n\r\nOne issue I have is that the new default colorscheme to **break** many existing legacy colorschemes that are based on the plain \"vim\" colorscheme. Those legacy colorschemes --- including [those are \"shipped with neovim\"](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/master/runtime/colors) and [community-maintained collections](https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes) or [curations](https://vimcolorschemes.com/) --- are affected and now look quite different because they did not exhaustively define all the highlight group being used, i.e. because of their implicit dependency/assumptions on the default (vim) colorscheme.\r\n\r\nColorschemes usually have `hi clear` at the beginning of the script file, but this reverts all the highlight configs back to the new neovim default; so having some lines like `:colorscheme vim` or `:source colors/vim.vim early` in init.vim will have no effect. These lines must be put after `hi clear` in each of the colorscheme script.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a colorscheme does not explicitly define \"String\" as `:hi link String Constant` (which used to default to \"Constant\" -> \"Red\"), this will no longer have a highlight color same as \"Constant\" but \"NvimLightGreen\". This is a problem of a *legacy, outdated* colorscheme, so shouldn't be a major problem or blocker, but [we might have some decisions or suggested solutions for those legacy colorschemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/189nw6r/comment/kbvssn9/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\r\n\r\nAlso, the built-in colorschemes https://github.com/neovim/neovim/tree/master/runtime/colors would need an corresponding update or a removal.\r\n\r\n## Workaround or solutions\r\n\r\nOn an end user's side:\r\n\r\n- (1) Users should avoid using legacy vim colorschemes, and move to the modern, neovim-aware plugins that have a continued neovim support.\r\n\r\n- (2) An user whose config is unfortunately based on an \"old\" vim colorscheme (say `base_legacy`) can *copy* (or \"fork\") `colors/base_legacy.vim` into their neovim config and add the `source colors/vim.vim` line after `hi clear`). Sorry, you can't use a plugin any longer unless it is still maintained.\r\n\r\n- (3) Update your existing colorscheme or config to explicitly configure all the built-in highlight groups, that behave differently e.g. `WinSeparator`, `String`, `Function`, `MoreMsg`, `WarningMsg`, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunity/plugin:\r\n\r\n- (4) The maintainer of colorschemes should update their plugin to make it \"aware of neovim 0.10\" -- but I don't think is always possible; Many \"legacy\" colorschemes are no longer updated and maintained (https://github.com/flazz/vim-colorschemes). I don't expect all the (legacy) colorschemes in such a \"collection\" (even including [a fork](https://github.com/EvitanRelta/vim-colorschemes)) can be updated.\r\n\r\nNeovim side:\r\n\r\n- (5) Add a backward-compatibility option for `hi clear` to allow an user to explicitly opt out of the new default colorscheme; e.g. if some switch is turned on, `hi clear` will revert to (or source) the `vim` colorscheme. Or, if `:colorscheme vim` is ever called once in user's `init.vim` or `init.lua`, `hi clear` will revert to the `vim` colorscheme instead of the new neovim default.\r\n\r\n  Since this is only to support an old vim legacy, I'm not sure if it is really worth doing to add a new flag or configuration point. But I don't see any other solutions that can make legacy vim colorschemes look exactly the same without changing the behavior of `hi clear`.\r\n",

            "body": "Thanks for this detailed issue!\r\n\r\nI think that the core issue of the new default color scheme being breaking is not really fixable. There are these main culprits:\r\n- Vim's default has group linking to the other group, while Neovim's new default has it linking to the other group or not link at all. Examples are indeed:\r\n    - `WinSeparator` was linking to `VertSplit`, but I changed to `Normal` as `VertSplit` is deprecated in Neovim.\r\n    - `String` and `Function` are now not linking but define their own foreground, as those are two main targets for \"green\" and \"cyan\" colors.\r\n    - `@variable` and `@lsp.type.variable` are cleared instead of linking to `Identifier` to reduce visual noise.\r\n    - `DiagnosticFloating*` now don't link to `Diagnostic*`, but this will probably be reverted.\r\n    - There might be more...\r\n- Vim's default defines colors explicitly, while Neovim's links them. I *don't think* there was such change, but I might misremember something.\r\n- Vim's default doesn't define certain attribute (`guibg`, for example), while Neovim's default does. This will probably be brought to a bare minimum in the follow up PR in the (hopefully) near future.\r\n\r\nI don't really agree on `MoreMsg` and `WarningMsg`, though. Both in Vim's and Neovim's default they only define `guifg` and `ctermfg`, son only colors changed.\r\n\r\nMy initial suggestion for the users of \"old\" *non-built-in* color schemes is to patch the highlight groups which differ from Vim's default behavior. There won't be many. Mostly because this is already the case with Neovim-specific highlight groups (`NormalFloat`, `Diagnostic*`, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor *built-in* color schemes (retrobox, habax, etc.) Neovim maintainers should update them. **But** as far as I can tell by the their code, they all define every highlight group explicitly (as color scheme plugins should, in my opinion, if they want stability). Would you mind pointing at exact difference?",
