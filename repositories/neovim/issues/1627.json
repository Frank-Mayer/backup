    "body": "Currently, the `returns_nonnull` attribute is only enabled for gcc 4.9+ because that's the only place where I've been able to confirm its existence. However, while reading over some slides form a recent LLVM summit I've encountered a clue that this might be in a mainline version of clang. \n\nNote that this is despite the fact that the clang docs don't specifically mention it. That said, those same docs don't mention many other attributes which clang provably supports.\n\nWe've noticed that at least gcc 4.9 definitely changes its code generation when it encounters that argument, which can lead to cleaner, smaller and faster assembly.\n\nThe slides: http://llvm.org/devmtg/2014-10/Slides/Finkel-IntrinsicsMetadataAttributes.pdf\n\nI've also found commits that indicate that the clang static analyzer can now take `returns_nonnull` into account. This should be good news for the project and @elmart in particular!\n\nJust logging it here for future reference since I still can't contribute code to the project.\n",
