However, this solution will not be persistent, correct? If the client is closed, the layout is gone.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThis problem has already been faced by terminal multiplexers, and the solution was something like **sessions** in tmux. Another layer on top of the collection of tabs, so that if different clients are connected to different sessions, they can work without disturbing each other (visually at least). And the sessions persist, so that you can reconnect to a session later.\r\n\r\nIn vim/neovim, the term \"session\" is probably not a good idea, as it is already used for other things. I would use the term **workspace** - this is a [feature of wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/recipes/workspaces.html) that is similar to tmux sessions.",
