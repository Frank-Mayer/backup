Instead when you hit `n` it acts like that pattern isn't even there. I've confirmed this behavior is happening with no plugins installed at all.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- search for something like `/foo`\n- exit search, and run `:lua vim.fn.histadd(\"search\", \"bar\")`\n- hit `n`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nYou should go to the next instance of 'bar', but instead you go to the next instance of 'foo'.\n\n### Nvim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.2\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nMacOS 15\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWarp\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBrew",
