It also seems inconsistent that `imsearch` wasn’t disabled in the same commit as `imcmdline`.\n\nI suggest the following:\n- remove `imcmdline` and `imdisable`\n- disable and remove `imsearch`\n- make all command-line input obey `iminsert`\n- make c_CTRL-^ behave the same as i_CTRL-^\n\nThis would make everything more consistent and intuitive (I remembered being jarred when I started using lang-mappings and discovered that they were toggled separately in each mode). As a bonus, it will let us remove the confusing prose in `:help c_CTRL-^`.\n\nThis is of course incompatible with Vim and should be documented as such.\n",
