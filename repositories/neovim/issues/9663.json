We could  introduce the \"f\" prefix similar to \"p\" family of commands (`:pclose`, `:ptag`).  \r\n  - `:fclose` closes the highest z-index, and `:[count]fclose` closes window at  `count` z-index.  \r\n  - `:fclose!` closes all floats.\r\n- ~~Or a `:float` modifier? Analogous to `:vertical`, `:tab`, etc.~~ [#12050](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/12050)\r\n\r\nInstead of introducing analogs for `:pedit`, `:ptag`, etc., there could be a global option that configures the \"preview window\" to be a floating window (with  default position, dimensions, etc.).",
