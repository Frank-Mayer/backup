There are known attacks that paste content other than the user's selected text in a paste-from-browser scenario. Therefore, this attack may succeed if we terminate the paste with `CTRL-c`, etc.\r\n\r\nIMO: The preferred solution to this problem is when `tinput_read_cb()` finishes with `input->past != 0`, set a timer that will terminate the paste if the next sequence does not arrive with a long enough timeout(e.g. 5sec).",

If the terminal is not sending the end-of-paste sequence(`\\x1b[201~`), then that is the terminal problem, not neovim. I think https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/13921#issuecomment-782811093 is a good reference on how to check.
