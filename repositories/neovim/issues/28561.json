    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen I use Neovim in a terminal and copy paste some text in insert mode, I expect the effect to be more or less as if I wrote that text with the keyboard instead of pasting it. When recording a macro, that's not the case: if I record a macro and paste some text (for example to add a line of text) during the recording, then that text is not added when executing the macro.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n- Copy some text to the clipboard\r\n- Start a terminal that supports bracketed paste mode (I tested with gnome-terminal and wezterm)\r\n- Start Neovim (nvim --clean)\r\n- Start a macro: [q][q]\r\n- Start insert mode: [i]\r\n- Paste the text in the terminal with [Ctrl-Shift-V]\r\n- Exit insert mode and stop the macro: [Esc], [q]\r\n- Replay the macro: [@][q]\r\n\r\nResult: the text is not added again.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe macro should add the text that was copy-pasted during the recording.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.9.6-dev-18+g0ef27180e\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo (Vim 9.1)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian testing\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal 3.50.1\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nBuild from repo (0.9 branch)",

And the handler would need to insert the pasted text in exactly the right place (in the register).
