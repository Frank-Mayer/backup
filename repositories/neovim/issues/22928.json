    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI was wondering whether plugins would have the need for translation via https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Libraries. Neovim uses gettext to translate UI messages. Plugins usually present UI messages is English. \r\n\r\nI don't know whether there is interest in having translated UI messages for plugins\r\n- Documentation via vim help files and README is completely in English. So Vim users using plugins are usually able to read English.\r\n- Creating the translations requires a lot more maintainers. Plugins are usually maintained by small number of people\r\n- Developer communication mostly happens in English so we often don't hear from users wishing to have more localization for plugins\r\n- Lua plugins could ship lua binding to gettext if they really need it (too much effort for little gain?)\r\n\r\nI've remember seeing plugins that provide bilingual documentation Chinese/English. I would like to have some discussion on this topic, because I absolutely don't know whether people would be interested in this.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`dgettext`/`bindtextdomain` could be exposed via Lua API. Plugins could then generate their own translation files and use for displaying user visible messages. Alternatives  could be\r\n- suggesting this feature directly to github.com/vim/vim\r\n- to expose it via `vim.api` \r\n- plugins could ship getopt themselves (e.g. luarock packages)\r\n- plugins could use the C functions directly via C FFI\r\n- plugins in general don't need translation (?)",
