For instance, each section should be formatted like a table.  In the 'Basic Editing' section 'starting' should be in the first column and its corresponding description is in the second column.  In the next line you should see 'edit-files' and its corresponding description. Instead all the subsections are joined together in a paragraph.\r\n\r\nPages like https://neovim.io/doc/user/insert.html#insert.txt are also hard to read.\r\n\r\nI didn't take the time to examine the script that generates the online manuals.  However, I did see a recent commit to it in regards to word wrapping.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nView the reference manual online.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the the contents of the online user manual to be formatted/wrapped similarly to the how neovim shows the same manual.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNot applicable\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nNot applicable\n\n### Installation\n\nNot applicable",
