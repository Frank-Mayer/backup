    "body": "### Problem\n\n  Greetings,\r\n\r\n  I use nvim for writng prose. As such, nvim's initial state is unusable for my particular needs and I have heavily (and awkwardly,) customized it (in a way that would perhaps baffle programmers.)\r\n\r\n  Still, nvim's chimeraeness  has allowed me to create a distraction-free typing environment I have come to love and consider superior to the (many) other editors that are traditionally thought of as prose-centric.\r\n\r\n  A few days ago I decided to tinker a bit in my vimrc and fix the one last thing that I see as a distraction.\r\n\r\n  The guicursor in insert mode.\r\n\r\n  My plan was to remove it completely (when in  insert mode,) and emulate the typing experience of a typewriter.\r\n\r\n  To that effect I set guicursor to i:ver0 and i:nil. The first I inferred from the wiki (neovim.io) while the latter was just a stab in the dark.\r\n\r\n  i:ver0 returns \"invalid percentage,\" and i:nil also outputs an error message. Neither works.\r\n\r\n  My programming skills are lackluster to say the least, so I apologize in advance if nvim is already capable of the feature I am requesting and I just missed the how-to in the wiki.\r\n\r\n  Thank you for your time your efforts and nvim in general, by a non-conventional user of nvim,\r\n  \r\n  Anthony\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nBe able to set guicursor to nil / 0% in insert mode for truly distraction-free environment.",
