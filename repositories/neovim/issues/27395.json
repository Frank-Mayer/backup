The rest of the code in rpc.lua is doing similar sanity checking, for example giving good error messages if the LSP server returns a number, which is clearly also invalid. We should not silently ignore these issues, but we also shouldn't just crash inside a random NeoVim rpc.lua file because of dereferencing a nil.",
