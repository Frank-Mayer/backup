Split vim tab into several windows\r\n2. Perform some windo operation, for example `windo pwd`\r\n3. After the operation, the current window changes to the last window in the tab, no matter which window you executed the command from\r\n\r\nDoes it make a lot of sense? Seems more natural to me that the current window should not change after that. I am pretty sure there is a way to implement similar functionality in vimscript or lua, but shouldn't core windo behave \"properly\" out of the box?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCurrent window stays intact after windo.",
