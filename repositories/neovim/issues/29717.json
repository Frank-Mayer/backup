In fact, I have also seen similar discussions here: [#10106]ï¼Œbut there seems to be no valid conclusion(https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/10106)\r\n\r\nIf logos of the same type can be aligned in the same column, it will enhance the visual experience, so I am looking forward to this feature being supported, thanks!",
