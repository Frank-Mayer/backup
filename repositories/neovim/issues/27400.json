    "body": "### Problem\n\nAt the moment, `lsp.buf.references` [requires my cursor to be on the word for which I want to get references (calls the make_position_params function)](https://github.com/rudiejd/neovim/blob/bcf96538143564bc8de26c5db28df7cfbaf8025a/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/util.lua#L1961). If I want to request references for a symbol that isn't under my cursor, I first have to navigate there then navigate back. This also applies to `lsp.buf.implementation`, `lsp.buf.definition`, etc. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIn Lua, I should be able to pass my own [TextDocumentPositionParams](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentPositionParams) to my LSP server so that I can utilize all of these functions for any symbol in the buffer, not just the one under my cursor. \r\n\r\nRight now, my alternative options for this seem to be:\r\n1. Do `lsp.buf_request` in lua and pass whatever parameters I want\r\n2. Change the cursor to the position of my request, make the request, and change it back\r\n\r\nIf adding the ability to pass position isn't desired for any of the `lsp.buf` module functions, I can go with (1), but to me this seems like a feature that should be standard.

I frequently work in a C# codebase, and I often want to easily switch from inherited classes to the interfaces from which they are inherited. Since this inheritance is often 1:1 (an unfortunate, but common pattern in C#), 9 times out of 10 I can figure out the name of the interface I want to go to from the filename. I want to make a `textDocument/definition` request for the current filename, prefixed with `I`. For example, if I'm in the `FooFactory`, I want to go to the `IFooFactory`.\r\n\r\nHere's the code I ended up using. -  note that the LSP handler for `textDocument/references` does add an entry to the jumplist, but this is a minor inconvenience for me. \r\n\r\n```lua\r\n      local inherited_interface_position = function(lsp_request)\r\n          -- find the position of the name of the file with 'I' preprended\r\n          local lnum, col = unpack(vim.api.nvim_eval('searchpos(\"I\" . expand(\"%:t:r\"))'))\r\n          local text_document_identifier = vim.lsp.util.make_text_document_params()\r\n          -- uses zero based indices\r\n          local position = { line = lnum - 1, character = col }\r\n          -- https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#referenceParams\r\n          local params = { position = position, textDocument = text_document_identifier, context = { includeDeclaration = true } }\r\n\r\n          vim.lsp.buf_request(0, lsp_request, params)\r\n      end\r\n```",
