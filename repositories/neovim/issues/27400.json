    "body": "### Problem\n\nAt the moment, `lsp.buf.references` [requires my cursor to be on the word for which I want to get references (calls the make_position_params function)](https://github.com/rudiejd/neovim/blob/bcf96538143564bc8de26c5db28df7cfbaf8025a/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/util.lua#L1961). If I want to request references for a symbol that isn't under my cursor, I first have to navigate there then navigate back. This also applies to `lsp.buf.implementation`, `lsp.buf.definition`, etc. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIn Lua, I should be able to pass my own [TextDocumentPositionParams](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#textDocumentPositionParams) to my LSP server so that I can utilize all of these functions for any symbol in the buffer, not just the one under my cursor. \r\n\r\nRight now, my alternative options for this seem to be:\r\n1. Do `lsp.buf_request` in lua and pass whatever parameters I want\r\n2. Change the cursor to the position of my request, make the request, and change it back\r\n\r\nIf adding the ability to pass position isn't desired for any of the `lsp.buf` module functions, I can go with (1), but to me this seems like a feature that should be standard.
