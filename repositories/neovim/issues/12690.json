I don't think the `BufUnload` autocommand is triggered in vim in such a case. I couldn't get `au` to print anything at all.\r\n- Operating system/version: Debian 10 buster. (Linux 4.19)\r\n- Terminal name/version: gnome-terminal 3.30\r\n- `$TERM`: screen-256color\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvim -u NORC\r\n:au BufUnload * echo expand('<afile>')\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow open a file to edit using the `:e` command. Let's say `:e test`\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nThe name of the file currently opened is printed. In the example case, `test` is printed.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThe name of the buffer being unloaded should be printed. (In this case `[NO NAME]`). The wrong name is printed only when a `[NO NAME]` buffer is unloaded.\r\n\r\nI think it's because the newly opened buffer gets the same number as the `[NO NAME]` one. Though I am not too sure of if this actually is the reason why this is happening.\r\n",
