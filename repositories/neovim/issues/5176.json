However, there doesn't seem to be an issue bringing the previous buffer back into play when only running a single window. I wonder why that would be?\n\nAs for the code you provided, the buffer return seems to work like a charm :)! Many Thanks!\nAlthough - on your end, does the original file come back without any syntax highlighting?\n",

I really appreciate your willingness to help me with this!\n\nWhen putting the line `executre 'doautocmd FileType' buf` into the function, I get this error:\n\n`E474: Invalid argument: syntax=config/routes.rb` I checked the [`syntax=` function for vim](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html). It looks like it basically is just taking in a syntax specification.\n\n`config/routes.rb` is the path to the file that is being re-opened in the split.\n\nAfter the error, the file is still without color (which I assume is because the error itself is blocking it).\n\nMy vim-fu isn't very strong - so I apologize if I'm missing something here!\n\nHere's the code I have with your suggested addition:\n\n```\nfunction! s:termclose() abort\n  let first = max([1, line('w0') - winheight(0)])\n  call setreg('t', getline(first, line('$')), 'V')\n  let buf = expand('#')\n  if !empty(buf) && buflisted(buf) && bufnr(buf) != bufnr('%')\n    execute 'autocmd BufWinLeave <buffer> split' buf\n    execute 'doautocmd FileType' buf\n  endif\nendfunction\n```\n",
