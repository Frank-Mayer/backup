It's still very easy to build and download any cmake version (either\r\nmanually or with something like PPA/backports).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## 3.17\r\n- Didn't find anything useful\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n- Ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n## 3.18\r\n- CheckLinkerFlag module\r\n- `REQUIRED` option for all \"find_\" commands.\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n- Fedora 32\r\n\r\n## 3.19\r\n- `string` gained `JSON` subcommands\r\n    - Allows us to specify dependencies in JSON instead of our bespoke format in `cmake.deps/deps.txt`\r\n- cmake presets are introduced\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n- Debian 11\r\n- Fedora 33\r\n\r\n## 3.20\r\n- Extended path manipulation with `cmake_path`.\r\n- `target_sources()` now supports targets created by `add_custom_target()`.\r\n- `EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS` target property, allows us to remove little bit of\r\n  code.\r\n- `CPACK_THREADS` packaging goes brrrr.\r\n- `presets` gained support for build and test presets.\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n\r\n## 3.21\r\n- Extended support for presets\r\n- `--install-prefix` flag to specify install location\r\n- `PROJECT_IS_TOP_LEVEL` variable to check if neovim is used as a dependency by\r\n  another cmake project.\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n\r\n## 3.22\r\n- Nothing useful\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n\r\n## 3.23\r\n- File sets which is an exciting new feature that does...something.

Probably not, but maybe.\r\n#### Drops support for\r\n- Debian 12 (bookworm)\r\n- Ubuntu 23.04\r\n\r\n## 3.27\r\n- \"Apple text-based stubs (i.e. .tbd files) may now be created for shared\r\n  libraries on macOS\".
