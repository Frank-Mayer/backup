Sorry for the inconvenience, feel free to add it there or delete this comment. \r\n\r\nautoselect feature of clipboard is one of the most used features in vim for me. Lack of it keeps me switching to neovim and enjoying it. \r\n\r\nThere is a workaround mentioned in #2325 but it is not consistently working (not usable for me). \r\nThe suggested workaround is to use the settings: \r\n\r\n```\r\n set mouse=a\r\n vmap <LeftRelease> \"*ygv \r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\nWith the above settings enabled using mouse select one or two lines of text, but release the mouse button somewhere out of the selection paint (i.e. release when mouse pointer is out of the selected region)\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nNothing is copied to registers. Note that if you release mouse when pointer is still inside the selected region then it works fine (I can actually see the text selection blink once in that case).\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nText selected should be copied to register   \r\n\r\n",
