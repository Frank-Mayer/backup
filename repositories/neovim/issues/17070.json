I use solarised in light mode and initially I thought this was a 256 colour / theme issue. After fixing the 256 colour setup I was left with strange border colours only in my theme, some manual investigation then found that background was being detected incorrectly. I'm working around this by forcing it to light, but thought I'd raise the issue as I couldn't find any similar reports. Have a great day.",
