Type \"qaaaaa<Esc>q\"\n2. Press \"@a\", watch \"aaa\" get inserted.\n3. Press \"qaq\", then \"@a\" again.\n4. Nothing happens, as is expected.\n5. Close and open again neovim.\n6. Press \"@a\", \"aaa\" gets inserted despite the register being cleared in the previous session.\n\n\":let @a=''\" instead of \"qaq\" produces exactly the same bug.

In fact, it doesn't seem like `:rshada` is doing anything at all: if you had some recording in a register, and then clear it (with, say, `qaq`), and after that read shada file with `:rshada`, the register stays empty. So either it's a bug with `:rshada` command, or it's somehow possible to differentiate between an empty and unused register for when merging shada files, else the register would have been overwritten with the sequence you had stored in that register before opening nvim.\nSorry if that description is confusing, if you want, I can rephrase it. Also, could you reconsider labeling this as a bug rather than a design choice? It doesn't really make sense making a simple task of deleting a register so complicating.\n",
