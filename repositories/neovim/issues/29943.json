Unfortunately the current implementation of `inspect_tree` doesn't offer hooks (as far as I can tell) to add user defined mappings.\r\n\r\nI implemented the feature I want, and it works (https://github.com/neovim/neovim/compare/master...Lattay:neovim:open_injection_query_editor it's a very simple change), but I also figured from the perspective of Neovim it may be more interesting to add a hook in `inspect_tree` instead...\r\n\r\nIs this feature interesting by itself, or too specific? Should I propose a hook in `inspect_tree` instead so that users can define custom mappings for this buffer?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nPressing O, the user is prompted to select a language in the list of active parsers. Uppon selection the query editor is opened for the selected language.",
