But of course we should make that upper bound as high as we can.\r\n\r\nFor context, the polling mechanism is used for Linux because inotify doesn't watch recursively, and libuv doesn't set up the inotify handles in a way that makes it practical (that I've found) to structure those recursively ourselves. Node.js `fs.watch` also uses libuv polling on Linux for recursive watches. I think the ideal scenario here would involve leveraging a yet-to-exist kernel-level recursive file watcher for Linux like libuv does already for macOS and Windows.\r\n\r\n@lucy You're right that filtering these files out would probably help. Right now all of that filtering is done in the LSP client after the poller is already set up, but some of that could be done earlier and lighten the load on libuv. For your example with a huge directory of files not watched by the LSP it would probably make a decent difference. I'll try that to see.\r\n\r\ncc @mfussenegger ",

(I think currently using two clients would end up having each client register their own watchers)\r\n- Deal with watcher limits (`proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches`)\r\n- Configuration for excludes? From my testing it looks like there are a lot of folders watched that wouldn't need to be. See https://github.com/search?q=watcherExclude&type=code\r\n\r\n- The `parse` function that converts a glob pattern to a lpeg pattern could probably get moved to some other location. It uses standard glob syntax, nothing specific to LSP:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe glob pattern to watch relative to the base path. Glob patterns can have the following syntax:\r\n- `*` to match one or more characters in a path segment\r\n- `?` to match on one character in a path segment\r\n- `**` to match any number of path segments, including none\r\n- `{}` to group conditions (e.g. `**​/*.{ts,js}` matches all TypeScript and JavaScript files)\r\n- `[]` to declare a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[0-9]` to match on `example.0`, `example.1`, …)\r\n- `[!...]` to negate a range of characters to match in a path segment (e.g., `example.[!0-9]` to match on `example.a`, `example.b`, but not `example.0`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it fits into `vim.fs`, or a `vim.glob`?\r\n",

Note that some LSP (such as haskell-language-server) do have a fallsback mecanism (slow in the case of HLS) when the `didChangeWatchedFiles` is not enabled. So my implementation can be useful when:\r\n\r\n- Having `didChangeWatchedFiles` disabled is painfully slow\r\n- Turning it on kills neovim\r\n\r\nThe drawbacks is that if a file change by an external process (e.g. `git checkout`), the editor will be completely lost. I'm now used to this (I was used to patch HLS in order to make it think that `didChangeWatchedFiles` was supported by neovim, see https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/3458#issuecomment-1400903415",
