This version lacks a lot of features that makes life better. However, up to version 0.8.3 the Neovim project did add a Debian package to the release. \r\nNow I have to download the source and generate my own Debian package to update to the latest stable release.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRequested:\r\nAdd a Debian to the list of available downloads for Neovim. \r\n",
