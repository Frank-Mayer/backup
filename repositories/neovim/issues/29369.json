Open `init.lua` config file\r\n  2. wait for `LSP` and other stuffs to load\r\n  3. Jump around end of the file (currently line 909)\r\n  4. Put the cursor on top of the closing `)`\r\n  5. Press `%`\r\n\r\nEven trying the other way around doesn't work properly; To check:\r\n  1. Jump to `lazy` setup line (Currently 227)\r\n  2. Put the cursor on opening `(` after setup\r\n  3. Press `%`\r\n\r\nIt jumps to a commented line (803) `va)`!\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect it to regard commented lines according to language and _LSP_ but it does not.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, 9.0.749\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 20.04 LTS\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal-server\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nUbuntu Snap",

There's extended support using legacy regex syntax, but that is disabled when treesitter highlighting is enabled (by default for Lua). (LSP is irrelevant here.)\r\n\r\nEither \r\n1. set `:syntax on` or\r\n2. install a more full-featured matchit plugin with treesitter support (such as `matchup`).",
