Recently I've had a strange issue where it seems on startup that there's a rouge `rg` being issued.\r\n\r\nI did a `git bisect` to find that the commit that introduces this problem for me is ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe (by @gpanders).\r\n\r\nI can't reproduce this problem with `xterm`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n* Given a simple `test.txt` with only the word \"ABCD\" on the first line.\r\n* I open `urxvt`\r\n* I run `nvim --clean test.txt`\r\n* I observe that the buffer contains \"gBCD\" and that it is changed (as shown in screenshot below)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/998898/98debdfe-6ae4-407c-82a8-b6e7f062f68a)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBuffer is not changed on start.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.10.0 ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nurxvt v9.31\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nrxvt-256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nbuild from repo",

First, do I understand correctly that, since I'm currently relying on the `neovim-git` version from Arch AUR, I will have to wait until an official release of libtermkey?

We learned recently that libtermkey [neovim/libtermkey#4](https://github.com/neovim/libtermkey/pull/4), so if my theory is correct what is likely happening is that st is sending us the OSC 11 response and it is not being interpreted correctly by termkey as an OSC sequence. Thus, it never gets sent in the TermResponse autocommand and is instead treated like regular terminal input, where it then appears in Nvim.\r\n> \r\n> @gpanders If I understand correctly, you mean that your theory for `st` also holds for `urxvt`? If so, then I could attempt to verify this by following the steps you outlined.\r\n\r\nNo, urxvt seems to have a different problem altogether. I can't run urxvt locally to verify, so I'm only going off of what @zeertzjq suggested, but it _seems_ like urxvt doesn't recognize ST (`\\e\\\\`) as a valid terminator, but it does accept BEL (`\\a`).\r\n\r\nYou can very easily verify this yourself though. In urxvt enter `printf '\\e]11;?\\e\\\\'` in your shell and let me know what it spits back. Then do the same with but with `printf '\\e]11;?\\a'` (note the different terminator).",

Your screenshot confirms what @zeertzjq also said, urxvt is not including the `\\` character in its reply, so libtermkey is not interpreting the reply as an OSC sequence. Instead, the whole reply is treated as regular input. As in, Neovim thinks you are literally typing the keys `11;rgb`. The `rg` in that string is what’s responsible for that `g` character replacing the `A` in `ABCD`.\r\n\r\n",

Generally speaking, we (as in Neovim, the project) want to write our code in a way that is best for us (the maintainers) and our users. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe is undoubtedly a win from a maintenance and \"code cleanliness\" perspective. It _has_ caused issues for users, but all of these issues are bugs caused by the broader ecosystem, which https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe has helped to uncover. The change itself is correct from Neovim's perspective.\r\n\r\nReverting https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe allows those bugs to creep back into their dark holes and linger longer.

Or, alternatively, add someway to avoid the autocommand altogether?\r\n> \r\n> Reverting is _an_ option, but not one that I am in favor of. Generally speaking, we (as in Neovim, the project) want to write our code in a way that is best for us (the maintainers) and our users. [ab102f1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe) is undoubtedly a win from a maintenance and \"code cleanliness\" perspective. It _has_ caused issues for users, but all of these issues are bugs caused by the broader ecosystem, which [ab102f1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe) has helped to uncover. The change itself is correct from Neovim's perspective.\r\n> \r\n> Reverting [ab102f1](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/ab102f188e86bdbfce1d4de2ef633092a906e8fe) allows those bugs to creep back into their dark holes and linger longer. Eventually, they will pop up again and bother someone else. The right course of action is to fix the bugs.\r\n\r\nThanks; very well put. I fully agree with this.\r\n\r\nNow, I would be more than happy to help get things fixed at urxvt upstream. However, it is hard for me to properly explain this bug because I don't quite understand it myself.\r\n\r\n> > > 2. Change the terminator in our query to BEL, which will cause problems everywhere that isn’t using our patched version of libtermkey, until a new version is released and distros upgrade\r\n> > \r\n> > \r\n> > This does not sound like a good choice.\r\n> \r\n> We will not release a new version of Neovim without some kind of plan to distribute these patches to libtermkey. Option 2 is most likely what we will end up doing.\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm being slow, but does going for option 2 mean that I might not need to wait for a fix to urxvt itself? That is, will patches to libtermkey imply that we avoid the bug in urxvt?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI do get the feeling that it will be quite a lot of time until we're at a situation where bleeding edge neovim will work properly. Thus, I would be very glad to find a workaround in the meantime. I tried commenting out the `do ... end` block in `$VIMRUNTIME/lua/vim/_defaults.lua`, which I would expect to fix the problem. But surprisingly (to me), it does not.",
