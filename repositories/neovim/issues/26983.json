If it's more suitable for discussion elsewhere (e.g., [Discussions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/discussions), [Chat](https://app.element.io/#/room/#neovim:matrix.org), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim)), and this type of change would be considered, I can move it there.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the following command will print `0.20` even though `has('nvim-0.20')` is false.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n:lua if vim.fn.has('nvim-0.20') then print('0.20') end\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because the Vim builtin functions return 1 for true and 0 for false, both of which are considered true in the Lua context.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThis feature request is to change the functionality so that builtin functions (that return boolean values) called through `vim.fn` would return `true` and `false` instead of `1` and `0`. This would break existing code that does something like the following to work around the issue:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n:lua if vim.fn.has('nvim-0.20') == 1 then print('0.20') end\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, boolean values that are components of e.g., returned dictionaries (not directly returned values), could also be booleans instead of integers. For example, the `loclist`, `quickfix`, `terminal`, and `winbar` items in the dictionaries returned by `getwininfo()`.\r\n\r\nOne way to make this change could be to update the Vim builtin functions themselves to return `v:true` and `v:false` instead of `1` and `0` (and similar updates for values within dictionaries and other container objects). That way, when translated to Lua, the returned values would become `true` and `false`. This would presumably not break Vimscript code since `v:true ==# 1` evaluates as true (more specifically, `1`). But the running example would work as-is:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n:lua if vim.fn.has('nvim-0.20') then print('0.20') end\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'll close the issue if this wouldn't be considered (e.g., not worth the cost of a breaking change or there is a technical limitation).",
