That's the motivation for libuv_process.c always setting UV_PROCESS_DETACHED on non-Windows. https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/6530\r\n\r\nNo I don't think so, which is why `detached` should probably be preferred if the process is expected to launch its own subprocesses: LSP, `make`, etc.\r\n\r\nEach way has its cons. I think this table is roughly correct.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>\r\n <td>attached (`setpgid()`)\r\n <td>detached (`setsid()`)\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>nvim crash\r\n <td>killed\r\n <td>orphaned\r\n<tr>\r\n <td>kill subprocess\r\n <td>doesn't kill descendants\r\n <td>kills all non-detached descendants\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nObivously this can change depending on how the subprocess launches its children. \r\n\r\nNeither is ideal, but given that I think most subprocesses are usually simple, defaulting to attached seems like the safest route.\r\n\r\nWith that said we should make sure that we add any necessary plumbing to make detached processes work as well as they can which means adding any cleanup logic to `vim.system` via a `VimLeave` autocmd.",
