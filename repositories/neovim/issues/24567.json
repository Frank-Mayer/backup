This just seems like more effort than it's worth. For most cases non-detached is what you want as it guarantees child processes won't be orphaned. Even if we try to cleanup detached processes ourselves, that cleanup won't happen in case of a crash.\n\n`jobstart` does some extra flags with the pipes which I think is more likely the culprit here.\n\n",
