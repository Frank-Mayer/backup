For example, here is the code for going to the next/previous window, which ignores focusable==false unless the window is also floating:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/7e65f3757bdbe41bbf022b05b6869ad6e7febe0d/src/nvim/window.c#L355-L374\r\n\r\nI'm working on an addon that adds \"companion windows\" for certain functionality where non-focusable, non-floating windows would be really useful. I note that it's possible to set the focusable flag on non-floating windows without error, and the fact that focusable only applies to floating windows is not mentioned in the docs. \r\n\r\n- I'd be happy create a PR to change window navigation to respect the focusable flag unambiguously. Can anyone who knows the project well think of a reason why this shouldn't be done?\r\n- If we can't fix the behaviour, I think we should at least fix the docs to be explicit about this. We should also consider returning an error when the focusable flag is set on a non-floating window, as we currently do for other attributes that are floating-only (borders for example). I'd be happy to create a PR for this too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nWhen the focusable flag is false for a non-floating window, I expect window navigation commands to skip the window.",
