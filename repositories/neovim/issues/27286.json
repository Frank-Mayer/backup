    "body": "### Problem\n\nThis issue is similar to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25365, but for the `alternate-file`. I previously opened this as a \"feature request\" issue but was told it fits more the \"bug report\" issue.\r\n\r\nIt often happens that when deleting a buffer (with `:bd`), say `file1`, that buffer is just unlisted and \"invisibly\" stays the `alternate-file` for another buffer `file2`. When `file2` is active, pressing `Ctrl-^` will make neovim attempt to re-open `file1`.\r\n\r\nProblems:\r\n- some buffers can't be reloaded\r\n- typically, a buffer was deleted for a reason, so it's unlikely that someone would use the `Ctrl-^` command with the intention to reload that buffer (although in certain scenarios this could be a valid use case)\r\n\r\nIf instead one doesn't just delete the buffer, but wipes it with `:bw`, then doing `Ctrl-^` as above, one gets the error \"E23: No alternate file\".\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`nvim --clean file1`\r\n`:e file2`\r\n`:e file3`\r\nNow, `file3` is active, and `file2` is the `alternate-file`.\r\n`:bd2` to close `file2`, and the active buffer is still `file3`.\r\npress `Ctrl-^`\r\nNow, `file2` is loaded again even though it was just deleted.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI believe that for most use-cases, it would be practical that when deleting/wiping a buffer, another buffer predictably becomes the alternate buffer. The most obvious candidate would be closest other listed buffer in the `jumplist`.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2250+g6bba4bece\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, vim 8.2\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nUbuntu 22.04\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkonsole 23.08.4\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nappimage (nightly)",
