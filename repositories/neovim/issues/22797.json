By \"forced\" serialization, I mean that we in `cmake.deps/cmake/BuildLuarocks.cmake` manually specify the following dependency chain:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlua/luajit <- mpack <- lpeg <- luabitop <- busted <- luacheck <- coxpcall\r\n```\r\n\r\nmeaning, that `coxpcall` depends on `luacheck`, `luacheck` depends on `busted` and so on. Of course, these \"dependencies\" are bogus, it's just to ensure luarocks doesn't install multiple rocks in parallel as it will emit warnings with possibly unpredictable behavior. Luarocks also doesn't (to my knowledge) allow installing multiple packages at once from the command line with something like\r\n\r\n```\r\nluarocks build <package A> <version> <package B> <version>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed solutions\r\n\r\nNothing at the moment. Suggestions welcome.",

I was hoping for a more long-term solution/perspective, but removing dependencies where possible is always nice of course :).\r\n\r\nI should mention that I don't consider the current situation *that* bad, although I would very much like to find a solution for it. By my very rough estimations, parallelizing the luarocks segment would reduce the time of running `cmake.deps/CMakeLists.txt` by around 30%, so probably at most a 10-30 seconds savings on non-potato computers. This isn't really a big deal as building dependencies shouldn't be needed regularly, but it becomes noticible when e.g. bisecting.",
