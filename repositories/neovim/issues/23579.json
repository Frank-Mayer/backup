From what I know\r\n\r\n* type marshalling: Yes, the component model takes away the burden of agreeing on a representation and writing the glue code from host (neovim) and plugin developers. At least for [the component types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Explainer.md#type-definitions), WASM compiler and runtime will handle the type conversion.\r\n* Event handlers, hooks, and callback: I believe this can be \"handle types\" in the same proposal. I'll need to looking to more for it.\r\n* Streaming: The next milestone for the component model will be supporting async futures and streams. They've released a [explainer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MNVOZ8hdofO3tI0szg_i-Yoy0N2QPU2C--LzVuoGSlE/edit#slide=id.p) and seems promising.\r\n* WASI / system stuff: There are a lot of possibility here. We can expose Neovim's libuv bindings, or use Wasi/wasix directly, or do both. This will give a huge benefit for WASM plugin interface: users will be able to controll what functions the plugin can use (whether it can read/write files, etc.)",

Most of the functions can be called from WASM module now (expect those requiring LuaRef and callbacks). Here is a [small module](https://github.com/bobogei81123/neovim/blob/wasm/wasm/example/simple_plugin/src/lib.rs) that calls `nvim_create_buf`, `nvim_open_win`, and `nvim_buf_set_lines` APIs:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2023-07-14 20-12-01](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/74331647/5b66ea7b-f0b3-419e-a450-4b1b006fd74f)\r\n\r\nSomething that can be done next:\r\n- Make callback works (probably need resource in the component module proposal?)\r\n- Port some simple plugin to WASM and see how well it works.\r\n- Implement Lua runtimes (LSP, etc.) natively.\r\n- Make API functions more friendly for WASM. And because WASM binds directly to the C API functions we should be able to do much more cool stuff.",

Also what would be the benefit beyond maybe saving some ram? Would it be worth the hassle? Every language has its own, unique server impl that would need to be ported separately/individually.\r\n\r\nOn a capable system, the only real gripe I have with lsp servers is the slow startup times of some servers like lua lsp (or, lack of features or typechecking, but that has nothing to do with neovim).",
