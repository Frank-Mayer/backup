Not sure, but if the detection is improved and cmake targets are used, it would be probably easier to let CMake do the right thing also on macOS.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nJust try building on macOS any neovim version (tested with 0.9.0 and 0.9.4) using as dependency `libluv-1.44` (tested with 1.44.2-0, 1.44.2-1, 1.45.0-0) will fail as soon as build starts using the `nvim` executable because it does not find `libluv` dynamic library.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIt should build 😁\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\ncommit d772f697a281ce9c58bf933997b87c7f27428a60 (HEAD, tag: v0.9.4, tag: stable)\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nnot applicable\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 13.6\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nnot applicable\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nnot applicable\n\n### Installation\n\nfrom source (using spack for convenience)",

Thanks to @haampie (\"the spack guy\"), who immediately spotted the problem, now it works.\r\n\r\nThe problem is as described above, i.e. on macOS if `neovim` ends up using dynamic library for `libluv` it does not work (since long ago), but the problem is imputable to `libluv` requiring an old CMake minimum version (ending up not using new policies, in particular ([CMP0042](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/policy/CMP0042.html).\r\n\r\nI would say that this does not require a fix on `neovim` side, since it should be `libluv` installing correctly the dynamic library with the `@rpath` tag in it. Actually `libluv` in the next version (1.46) is going to require a newer minimum CMake version, which will enable implicitly the CMP0042, solving the problem also on macOS.\r\n\r\nI don't know if you'd like to specify this constraint about `libluv` somehow in neovim. Up to you.\r\n\r\nAnyway, for what concerns the original reason for opening the issue, I would consider it solved. Hence I will close it and I will link to this issue for future reference (mainly in the spack package).",
