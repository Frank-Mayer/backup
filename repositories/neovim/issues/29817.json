    "body": "### Problem\n\nHi, we are in a situation where lua plugins use e.g. `goto`'s in their code that isn't compatible with Lua 5.1 because 99% use neovim with LuaJIT that does support `goto`'s. Because of this, these plugins cannot be used with neovim without LuaJIT even if they don't require LuaJIT at all. Do you still consider neovim with Lua 5.1 as the default under these circumstances? I think this affects ppc64el, riscv64, and s390x because they currently do not support LuaJIT, and PR's are ignored by the LuaJIT maintainer (https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/pull/631).\r\n\r\nE.g. the fzf-lua maintainer thankfully removed all the `goto`'s in his code lately because he was just not aware that his code wasn't compatible without LuaJIT even if it doesn't require LuaJIT: https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua/commit/e5c14900e8abaa962f6880853ce0f749b511aa85\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUse neovim without LuaJIT with e.g. a plugin that uses `goto`'s\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nIf neovim without LuaJIT is still seen as the default, neovim should support Lua 5.2 so that code works, that people wrote using neovim with LuaJIT (code that doesn't require LuaJIT at all). Switching to `luajit2` instead of `luajit` could also be an option.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nFedora\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nalacritty\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nsystem package manager",

The [linked PR](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/pull/631) makes me think this is no longer valid as @MikePall does not seem interested in supporting s390x for whatever reason. Unsure if the premise change is important enough to warrant a re-discussion on luajit vs luajit2 (I suspect not).",

If at some point we add official releases for s390x, we'll pick an interpreter to build against for it (very likely LuaJIT2, simply because it requires no build system changes -- but we'll burn that bridge when we come to it).\r\n\r\nNote the \"currently\" here, which is load-bearing: if a better interpreter comes along (e.g., luajit-remake, if that ever becomes a ting), we'll switch in a heartbeat.",

And they also want to ship with the same luajit version for all architectures. I would really appreciate if you help me to convince them to use luajit2 instead of luajit but then you would have the risk that they also ship neovim with luajit2 on x86.\r\n\r\nThis is all up to the distros. From Neovim's side, the only policy is \"link against a Lua 5.1 implementation\".\r\n\r\nSince LuaJIT isn't available on all architectures, distros are _already_ using different implementations on different architectures (LuaJIT where it's available and Lua where not).\r\n\r\nAs far as LuaJIT vs LuaJIT2, Debian actually had both for a while because there's some other software that *requires* LuaJIT2 (nginx, I think). A few months back, the package maintainers unified on the LuaJIT2 implementation but providing it under the LuaJIT name, so there wasn't a need (on the Debian side) to also differentiate between which LuaJIT implementation to use per architecture. However, we could have easily done that if necessary.\r\n\r\nI can double check whether s390x is working with LuaJIT as part of the work to get 0.10 packaged.",
