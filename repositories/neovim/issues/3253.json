I posted first an issue there: equalsraf/neovim-qt#33\n\nThe major use case I have for that is to map Ctrl-Tab the same way Alt-Tab is used in a window manager to switch between windows. Ctrl-Tab would be used to switch buffers in most recently used order. The list would be reordered when the Ctrl key is released only, and would make it much more accurate.\n",
