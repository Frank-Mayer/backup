            "body": "> Would it be possible to get a dynamic cmdheight, so that it is set to 0 when empty, and 1 when there is output?\r\n\r\nThis was the behaviour of `cmdheight=0` for a while, but it proved unsatisfactory in that the statusline would move up and done far too often (in very distracting ways); for example in user mappings which invoked the command line (even when `silent` was selected). There probably were other technical issues as well.\r\n\r\nThe current overwrite statusline behaviour is an improvement (in my opinion). But there is no doubt that `cmdheight=0` is still a work in progress and was clearly (and correctly) marked in the 0.8 release as experimental.\r\n\r\nMy two main issues, to me, are firstly this issue here, `Press ENTER to continue` occurs far too often, which interrupts workflow where `cmdheight=1` does not incur those same blocks. The second issue is the amount of statusline flicker that occurs due to mappings and plugins invoking Ex commands, basically the statusline will quickly flash away (overwritten by the command line) then come back again; for example hit down arrow in a Telescope file finding window (lots of statusline flickering).\r\n\r\nIdeally I would like the following (which may or may not be implementable):\r\n\r\n- No `Press ENTER to continue` messages for `cmdheight=0` if not present `cmdheight=1`.\r\n- Compact multi-line messages into a single line similar to how Neovim Diagnostic single-lines multi-line diagnostics for display in virtual lines\r\n- No statusline flicker/redraw for any Ex command invoked via mapping or plugin; only actual interactive command line usage should wipe the statusline for the commandline (I don't know how feasible this issue)\r\n\r\nUser folke recently introduced the [noice.nvim](https://github.com/folke/noice.nvim) plugin to move the command line into a floating window and emit messages using nvim-notify. Whist a step forward for some users it feels alien to me, not what I ideally want from the `cmdheight=0` feature (I like command line down low in the traditional place).\r\n\r\nFor now I still use `cmdheight=1`; but I really hope `cmdheight=0` continues to improve since I genuinely love the look; but for now the flicker and `Press ENTER to continue` are deal-breakers.\r\n\r\nMy 2cents.",
