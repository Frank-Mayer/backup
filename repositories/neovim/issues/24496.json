For better understanding, I will add picture. I already tried to change the Nerd font and it still happens.\r\n\r\nChanging to a different font then a Nerd Font resolves that strange behaviour.\r\n![2023-07-27_13-25-26](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/assets/110129538/8e36e99a-2450-49d8-989f-d50619630163)\r\n\r\nThis also happens on other files, where I use comments. For example ps1.\r\n\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n:help \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nLast chars should not be cutted on comments.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 22H2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\n-\n\n### Installation\n\nWinget",
