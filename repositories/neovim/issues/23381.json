    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen I'm working in the Linux kernel repo ([source]), I found that `gq` doesn't format comments and does nothing inside its source `.c` files.\r\n`gq` formats the code itself just fine, but just not the comments (neither block nor line ones)\r\n\r\nSome facts I've noticed:\r\n- Seen with both `filetype=c` (`.c` files) and `filetype=cpp` (`.h` files)\r\n- So far, I only see this happens in the Linux kernel repo, that means\r\n  - Editing the files in the repo reproduce the issue.\r\n  - Moving the files out of the repo (i.e. editing as single files) and editing is fine.\r\n  - Moving the files to other random Git repos (e.g. my own dotfiles/) and editing is fine.\r\n- Seen on macOS and Debian, both with Neovim 0.9.0\r\n- I use `neovim/nvim-lspconfig` to set up `clangd`, and the issue is gone by turning off `nvim-lspconfig`\r\n- Seems irrelevant to the existence of `compile_commands.json` - I have that in my Debian setup but not in macOS, both reproducible\r\n- `gq` doesn't work, but `gw` does!\r\n  - This is interesting and informative. Note that `gw` doesn't respect `formatprg` and `formatexpr`, so I checked and found that `formatexpr=v:lua.vim.lsp.formatexpr()` when the issue happens (and `formatprg` is empty BTW), so it must have something to do with `lua.vim.lsp.formatexpr()`. \r\n\r\nI actually tried to dig a little more into the neovim source, but due to my limited knowledge and time I haven't found more.\r\nHappy to learn and help investigate with some support from the experts  :)\r\n(e.g. how neovim devs do print-debug stuff and check the logs in easier way etc)\r\n\r\n[source]: https://github.com/torvalds/linux\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\n```\r\n# might take some time, can check out the mirror instead \r\n# https://kernel.googlesource.com/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux\r\ngit clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git \r\ncd linux/\r\nnvim -u minimal_init.lua drivers/clk/clk.c\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse `J` to combine the block comments in the beginning of the files, and the `gq` to format the comments.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`gq` should format the comments without issue, but it does nothing.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.9.0 Release\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nApple clangd version 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.102)\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS\n\n### Log file\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/fei6409/2146eef47d498dfa4cb0bf43f331199c",
