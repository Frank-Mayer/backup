Is there a way to use that same style/syntax for doing automated testing of plugins or other things?\n\nMy use case is that I want to write tests for specific behaviors that I want my neovim config to have and I definitely want to know if I ever break those behaviors (via including some other plugin or changing a config value or something).\n\nI searched around quite a bit and couldn't see a straightforward way to handle this, but it looks like the functional tests are run (somehow?) after the nvim binary is built. Is there some way to do the same with my Homebrew-installed nvim?\n",

I you check test/functional/helpers.lua, those are mostly helper functions build aroud lua-client.\n\nIncidentally if you want this to test plugins, there is also [Vroom](https://github.com/google/vroom) - but I think I just spotted a bug in its Neovim support, probably because API changes in python-client (**Edit:** followup here https://github.com/google/vroom/pull/104).\n",
