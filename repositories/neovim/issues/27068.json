Your work is amazing.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was ordered to add more test cases in my PR which I wonder why they didn't request on your PR.\r\nYou can see the diff here: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27202/files#diff-22260c58f0aad18ee7f70b3ae84f09fe6537b4136a2e0b87952ca560f81f1e7a and the specs they ordered me to follow were\r\n\r\n- Change all test string to `[[path/foo/bar]]` instead of single quotes.\r\n- Capitalizes drive name on Windows\r\n  - `eq('C:/foo/bar', vim.fs.normalize([[c:\\foo/bar\\/]]))`\r\n  - `eq('c/this/is/a/relative/path', vim.fs.normalize([[c\\this\\is\\a\\relative\\path]]))`\r\n- works with mixed forward and backward slashes\r\n  - `eq('C:/Users/jdoe', vim.fs.normalize([[C:\\/Users/\\jdoe/\\]]))`\r\n\r\nI think we should also add test against _drive-specific relative paths_ on Windows just in case according to Windows specifications.
