    "body": "### Problem\n\nI would like to write queries to highlight `InspectTree` specifically, but I can see that `InspectTree` is of filetype `query` and thus uses the `query` parser. \r\n\r\nI have tried to look through [neovim/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/dev.lua](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/treesitter/dev.lua) to see if there was anything I could target for setting up my queries. I tried targeting `vim.b.dev_inspect`, but I couldn't get the queries to work as expected. \r\n\r\nIf it already possible to easily write queries that will only be checked in `InspectTree`, then I can close this feature request, but I would like to be pointed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIf you are open to adding something extra to neovim to make something like this easier, I am also willing to spend some time and implement it myself, but I would first like some guidelines for how you want to implement it, if this is the case.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nAn easy way to do have separate highlighting for files of filetype `query` and highlighting for `InspectTree`. E.g. by something like:\r\n```lua\r\n-- lua code setting up highlights for filetype `query`\r\nif vim.b.is_inspecttree then\r\n  -- my own highlighting\r\nelse\r\n  -- standard highlighting\r\nend\r\n```",
