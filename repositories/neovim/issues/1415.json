I think people avoid it because they just haven't done it before, and don't know how to get all the right pieces into place.  I think we've gone a long way towards making that easier.  Combined with it being so easy to shove the installed neovim under it's own prefix, I'm not sure it's necessary.\n\nNote that the paradigm given in the FAQ doesn't clean up the file tree--it leaves empty directories lying around--and it won't include generated files (like the helptags).\n",

In a few words, this allows me to install things in `~/.user-prefixes` that can easily be removed.

            "body": "> IMO, not providing uninstall is the main reason why some users don't want to install from source to see if their problems reproduce that way.\n\nI agree with that and I am sorry to say that I do that. I had once installed `neovim` using `sudo make install` and had no idea how to do something equavalent to `sudo make uninstall`. For now, I will just do `make` in **Neovim**.\n",
