    "body": "### Problem\n\nWhen repeatedly executing a normal mode command with `vgo` as the motion, it alternates between being an inclusive and exclusive motion. This affects both built-in commands and plugins.\r\n\r\nVim also exhibits this, see vim/vim#15580.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Enter some text into a buffer.\r\n2. Place the cursor somewhere before the end of the buffer.\r\n3. Type `dvgo` in normal mode.\r\n4. Observe that all the text in the buffer before and including the cursor gets deleted.\r\n5. Type `dvgo` again, or type `.`.\r\n6. Observe that nothing gets deleted.\r\n7. Type `dvgo` again, or type `.`.\r\n8. Observe that the character under the cursor gets deleted.\r\n9. Repeat steps 5-8 as long as you want.\r\n\r\nNotably, moving the cursor (such as via `lh`) before step 5 prevents the issue; the next use of `dvgo` includes the cursor.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n`dvgo` should always delete all the text in the buffer before and including the cursor.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.10.1 and 0.11.0-dev-3a61f05dd\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nYes, vim 9.1.0697\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux x86_64 up-to-date as of 2024-08-23\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nAlacritty 0.13.2 (bb8ea18e)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\nArch Linux Repository",
