Other ephemeral files to consider for exclusion are the ones used for `git rebase` and `git send-email`. There may be other files outside the scope of Git to consider for exclusion, but these are the ones I can think of off the top of my head.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.4\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno, 9.0.2002\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux, updated as of 2023-10-12T00:00:00+02:00\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGnome Terminal 3.50.0\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nInstalled from Arch Linux' extra repository",
