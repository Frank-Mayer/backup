However, my understanding is that sixel support in libvterm is also an option for displaying images, right? I'm not familiar with the internals/architecture, but is it still the case that neovim's internal screen is composed of unicode characters of fixed size and hence will never be able to display images [1]? Is this unlikely to change?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1680\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2019-06-20 at 1 30 22 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1813121/59829628-206d6e80-92fb-11e9-90b0-1fe46d2188b4.png\">\r\n\r\nWith iterm2 3.0.0 beta it is now possible to display sixel images as well [2]. In the screenshot above on the left I'm able to display images using `imgcat` (iTerm2 escape codes) and using `cat` (SIXEL). \r\n\r\nOne valid use case for this feature is that these can be powerful tools for visualization / exploring data in scientific computing from the terminal interactively. It appears that tmux is not planning to support this [3], so neovim's terminal would make a highly appealing option to interactively run code and visualize data, all from the command line. \r\n\r\nIt'd be really cool to have one or both methods supported in neovim. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n[1] [https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4500](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4500)\r\n[2] https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/issues/3543#note_157693474\r\n[3] https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/1613\r\n",

Cursor shape changes\r\n2. Changing iTerm 2 title\r\n\r\nEverything worked as expected when I cat `/tmp/log` except `imgcat`, oscCallback is not triggered when `imgcat` runs. Seems like `libvterm` is doing its job. But when instead of `fd` I wrote to stdout, things got ugly and part of the prompt rendered out of the terminal window in another buffer. I guess in Neovim realm, communicating with the underlying terminal Is not as easy as directly writing to stdout.\r\n\r\nWe may be able to get rid of the virtual cursor and let the running application (bash, fish, node, etc) directly set the cursor shape by communicating with the underlying terminal emulator.\r\n\r\nAlso it may break some people's workflow, commands that were ignored in the past, now reach the underlying terminal emulator, there may be resize commands, setting title commands, setting working directory commands, etc so it will be a breaking change (someone may have an iTerm2 script that does something based on the title of the terminal and doesn't expect Neovim's embedded terminal change that, etc) so we may want to start with a feature flag that is disabled by default.\r\n\r\nNote for @leonerd: `imgcat` did not work as none of the fallback callbacks were called after running `imgcat`, I'm going to read the code to find out what are the conditions for calling `osc` callback and which condition is not satisfied with `imgcat` output.

So we will need to buffer fragments and concatenate them in a buffer before writing to terminal.\r\n\r\nWhen I hidden the buffer and opened it again, it didn't call the osc callback again (osc callback is called only once). I think this should be handled in Neovim and not libvterm and I think it won't be easy because some osc commands (like showing a notification, bouncing iTerm2 icon, etc) should run only once even if the buffer is hidden and shown again, but some like the one generated by `imgcat`, should run again exactly in the same place whenever the buffer is shown again. Deciding which osc command is in which category may need collaboration with iTerm2 developer for a general and future proof solution, alternatively we can hardcode the list of the commands in the second category in Neovim's codebase.",
