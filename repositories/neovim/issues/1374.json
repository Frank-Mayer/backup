    "body": "`readfile()` is a very important but mastodont-like function (1762 lines) at the moment of speaking. I've been trying to make more sense of it, but its structure is a bit hard to follow. Among other things because it likes to use internal goto's. I have no problem with goto's but in a 1762-line function it's a bit much.\n\nSo I had the idea of chopping it down to make it more understandable. One small win was that (I think) we can remove the parts that reference `try_mac` and `MACOS_CONVERT` since we don't support MacOS 9. That said, some people might want to edit files from that era, so I'm not sure if this would be broadly supported.\n\nBut extracting some functionality into functions would help readability and not impair functionality.\n\nThoughts?\n",

I just edited a 3.4GB file, deleting lines, etc. Three things to keep in mind:\n> - Press Ctrl-C: Vim tries to read in the whole file initially, to do things like syntax highlighting and number of lines in file, etc. Ctrl-C will cancel this enumeration (and the syntax highlighting), and it will only load what's needed to display on your screen.\n> - Readonly: Vim will likely start read-only when the file is too big for it to make a . file copy to perform the edits on. I had to w! to save the file, and that's when it took the most time.\n> - Go to line: Typing :115355 will take you directly to line 115355, which is much faster going in those large files. Vim seems to start scanning from the beginning every time it loads a buffer of lines, and holding down Ctrl-F to scan through the file seems to get really slow near the end of it.\n\nAnd then several uses claiming ctrl+c worked miracles for them and others claiming it only loads the file partially (which is what I would expect). I really wonder where this comes from, haven't been able to determine all the relevant parts for that in the source.\n",
