(dot-repeat has similar properties, but still has restrictions on line break manipulation, etc.)\r\n> \r\n> - [dmacro.el](https://github.com/emacs-jp/dmacro)\r\n> - [Dynamic Macro for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/tshino/vscode-dynamic-macro)\r\n> \r\n> I have used this pull request to develop a new plugin called https://github.com/tani/dmacro.nvim as a proof of concept. This is a plugin that greatly improves the user experience of dot-repeat, and could not have been implemented without this pull request. We hope you will consider adding the features to make neovim as customisable as competing text editors.",
