Here's my query:\r\n\r\n```scm\r\n(\r\n  (list_marker_minus)\r\n  (task_list_marker_unchecked)\r\n) @checkbox (#set! conceal \"ï˜±\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, only the first sibling, `list_marker_minus` gets concealed.\r\n\r\nHere's a file that I'm using as an example:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- [x] foo\r\n- [ ] bar\r\n  - [ ] baz\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere's what the syntax tree looks like:\r\n\r\n```scm\r\nsection [0, 0] - [3, 0]\r\n  list [0, 0] - [3, 0]\r\n    list_item [0, 0] - [1, 0]\r\n      list_marker_minus [0, 0] - [0, 2]\r\n      task_list_marker_checked [0, 2] - [0, 5]\r\n      ...\r\n    list_item [1, 0] - [3, 0]\r\n      list_marker_minus [1, 0] - [1, 2]\r\n      task_list_marker_unchecked [1, 2] - [1, 5]\r\n      ...\r\n      list [2, 2] - [3, 0]\r\n        list_item [2, 2] - [3, 0]\r\n          list_marker_minus [2, 2] - [2, 4]\r\n          task_list_marker_unchecked [2, 4] - [2, 7]\r\n          ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI feel like this is a pretty trivial use case. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThis does seem to be [an issue with treesitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/issues/1508). However, one way I see that Neovim could work around this is to add the ability to specify a start and an end to a conceal range with treesitter captures.\r\n\r\n```scm\r\n(\r\n  (list_marker_minus) @conceal_start\r\n  (task_list_marker_unchecked) @conceal_end\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I could through some new conceal API tell Neovim that I want everything between `@conceal_start`s and `@conceal_end`s to be conceald with some character, including (or excluding) the captures.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say?",

The whole current idea of Tree-sitter queries and captures exist around that captures points to distinct and concrete tree nodes and not to a set of some related nodes. At the same time nodes pointed by captures behaves like quick entry points into a tree where additional actions may be done over a nodes' API.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** To don't break the current queries API, it's possible to introduce a concept of _ephemeral_ nodes that would behave like just containers for point ranges and wouldn't allow to use nodes API on them. But I don't think that such additional complexity and concept worth to add just for one this use case, because this makes queries understanding even more harder.",
