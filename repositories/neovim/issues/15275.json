We could also have a \"default\" key in this table for a function that is called regardless of the particular method.\r\n\r\nVSCode has the (seemingly undocumented) `middleware` option which does this -- see, for example, [how it is used in the Lean 4 VSCode extension to trigger on `textDocument/didChange`](https://github.com/leanprover-community/vscode-lean4/blob/d5f1926be34e73af23d551be779a5b98e721e0ba/vscode-lean4/src/leanclient.ts#L122), which is what we'll be trying to replicate at Julian/lean.nvim#84.",
