It's sometimes convenient to rename entire folders as well. Though it's not clear when Neovim should emit such events, besides from within netrw. File management is often handled by other plugins, so supporting such use cases would require either introducing separate APIs for working with files and folders or wrapping `vim.uv.fs_*` calls to emit those events.\r\n\r\nThere is a plugin, which currently fills this gap between file-tree plugins and file-related LSP methods\r\nhttps://github.com/antosha417/nvim-lsp-file-operations",
