Get minimal_init.lua https://gist.github.com/jamestrew/7ba588b8c956db8c4829e6784b09f448\r\n2. Check out neovim 4c7462fd and build/install\r\n3. open nvim with `nvim -u minimal_init.lua`\r\n4. Close out of nvim with `:q`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nnvim promptly closes and can start typing in the terminal shell prompt almost immediately.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nTerminal hangs for approximately 2-3 secs and typing immediately after hitting `:q` results in something like this: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66286082/169629187-4152bfe8-2582-418f-b8db-505590cffa13.png)\r\n\r\nIt even shows a seg fault message occasionally after quitting.\r\n\r\n",

If you’re building from source to actually *use* Neovim, then you should set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable to Release or RelWithDebInfo when you run `make`.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the hang is that there are active libuv handles not being closed correctly, so Neovim is waiting for them to close before force-closing them. The “fix” is to find the offending plugins and fix it there.",
