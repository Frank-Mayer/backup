I figured it was a plugin, but I don't have that many plugins installed and couldn't find any bug report / post about this issue. If it's from another plugin it has to be from a popular one like nvim-cmp.\r\n\r\nI was also able to find a reddit post about this issue 3 months ago, if it helps at all https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/131dfzz/neovim_is_erasing_my_files_randomly_somehow/\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI could not 100% reproduce it, but it happens randomly when editing files. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nFor it to not randomly empty files\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nNo\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nOpenSuse Tumbleweed\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nterminator 2.1.3\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nOfficial Tumbleweed repos",
