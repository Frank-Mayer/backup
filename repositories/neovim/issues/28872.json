I understand that this is intended, and I am all for this when _adding_ a comment. However, IMO, it is a bit restrictive when toggling a comment (uncommenting).\r\n\r\nSay I have the following file. I am working together with someone, and they have added a comment here and does so without a trailing space. Maybe they have done this without a comment plugin or something\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n--local foo = 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy commentstring is the default one `-- %s`.\r\nToggling the comment will result in this:\r\n```lua\r\n-- --local foo = 10\r\n```\r\nThis can easily be fixed with using visual block mode, or adding a space and then uncommenting.\r\n\r\nHowever, say I have a project in C, and someone is commenting with the default commentstring of `/*%s*/`.\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint main() {\r\n    /*int foo = 10;*/\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I have the autocmd from the PR that always add a space, or maybe I have changed the commentstring to have a space: `/* %s */`. This is a surrounding comment, and will result in:\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint main() {\r\n    /* /*int foo = 10;*/ */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is even more annoying,, and I have to delete it from both sides of the line(s)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI would expect it to respect the commentstring 100% when commenting, and adding however many spaces there is in the commentstring option. However, I would also expect it to properly uncomment both of these examples, since they actually are comments, and I technically have the correct commentstring.\r\n\r\nI am open to looking into this, and sending a PR, but I would like to open an issue first to see what the general opinion is for this.",
