To reproduce: \r\n\r\n- Open a lisp file in a sufficiently nested directory, say, `my/new/lisp/proj/test.lisp`.\r\n- Attempt to navigate to a file in a parent directory by entering command line mode, typing `:e %:h`, expanding with `wildchar`, and deleting the previous word with `<c-w>`\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nThe entire path is deleted down to the space space before the `e`.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nThe problem lies in `runtime/ftplugin/lisp.vim`, where `iskeyword` is locally set to admit a menagerie of other symbols. This may be the intended behavior (in which case this would be more of a feature request), but I expect the locally set variable `iskeyword` for the current buffer to be decoupled from it's value in command line mode.",
