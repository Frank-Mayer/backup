There are also plugins like https://git.sr.ht/~whynothugo/lsp_lines.nvim that could benefit from having a more general way to enable showing the source in the message.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nProvide an option to `vim.diagnostic.setloclist()` to include the diagnostic source and/or provide a general mechanism to include the source in the diagnostic message. Something like a formatting function? Should there be something like that already (I tried to find anything, but couldn't) it needs better documentation.",
