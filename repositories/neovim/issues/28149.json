    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nPressing Ctrl-z while inside neovim, causes neovim to suspend (I guess), but the terminal is now also completely fronzen (and not the ctrl-s/ctrl-q type). Not only that, all the other terminals are also completely frozen (i.e not respond to keyboard at all). Also if I try to start new terminals they don't even \"boot up\" (i.e no PS1 shown). After closing the WM (riverwm), and going back to the bare TTY that was ALSO frozen (i.e no response from any kbd input). Also the other TTYs couldn't be started (i.e TTY2, TTY3).\r\n\r\nSo basically from that point on -- no working terminals whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty bizarre but also happened 2 times already, and I have to hard-reboot (i.e hold power button). Funnily enough non-terminals are fine (i.e browser windows).\r\n\r\nSetup: Arch Linux, riverwm, foot for terminal, pretty recent nvim (updated a few days ago, will update once I reboot :cry:)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- open nvim (from terminal)\r\n- open any file\r\n- click ctrl-z \r\n- happens every time a file is open, if no file is open it prints `zsh: suspended nvim`, and everything is fine\r\n- happens even in raw TTY (i.e no wayland/X)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nSuspend the nvim process, release the terminal in working order (and not mess up all other existing and future terminals).\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n```\r\nNVIM v0.9.5\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1702233742\r\n\r\n   system vimrc file: \"$VIM/sysinit.vim\"\r\n  fall-back for $VIM: \"/usr/share/nvim\"\r\n\r\nRun :checkhealth for more info\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nno\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nArch Linux\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nfoot\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm-color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\npacman (arch official repo)\r\n\r\nEDIT: This is reproducible (tried 2 more times with a single open file). Added nvim version (0.9.5)",

If I hit the power button on the machine then I see all the characters at the login prompt echo right away and the machine shuts down.\r\n\r\nThis also locks up other terminals.  Alacritty being the primary terminal, if I open kitty, the shell rc is not completely loaded and I never see a prompt, making this quite difficult to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nThis does not happen every time.  I regularly Ctrl+z to suspend the nvim job, and so I might be able to suspend perhaps twenty times or so before I run into this, but it seems that only a reboot fixes it.  I have seen this on two machines now, after recent updates for some xz patching.",

(e.g. set it in your `.zshrc`, or add an alias that launches nvim with that set `alias nvim=\"UV_USE_IO_URING=0 nvim\"`\r\n2) You can run a patched kernel (@ichernev posted good instructions above if you're using Arch Linux)\r\n3) You can disable io_uring on your system entirely (`sysctl kernel.io_uring_disabled=1`, doesn't persist through reboots)",
