The function grab_file_name appears to have some issue with parsing both the file name and the line number.\r\n\r\nFor instance, when trying to go to a file and line number using gf on the following line,\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nError: src/app/core/services/identity/identity.service.ts:64:23 - error TS2551: Property 'tfaSmsEn\r\ndClientClientOptOutAllowed' does not exist on type 'FullLoginResponse'. Did you mean 'endClientCli\r\nI get the error E447: Can't find file\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the error E447: Can't find file \"src/app/core/services/identity/identity.service.ts:64:23\". Even isolating the text does not help. This issue also persists in visual and block selection modes.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open a buffer with a line that contains a file path and line number like so:\r\n    `src/app/core/services/identity/identity.service.ts:64`\r\n2. Try using the gf command to navigate to the file and specific line number.\r\n\r\nNote: The issue seems consistent across multiple files and line numbers.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI expect the gf command to navigate to the specific file and line number mentioned in the text.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, vim 9.0.1403\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nWindows 11 Pro 22H2\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nGNU bash, version 5.2.15(1)-release (x86_64-pc-msys)\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nInstalled using Scoop on Windows.",
