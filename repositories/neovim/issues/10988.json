Bias towards, \"if I need a mutex, I'm doing it wrong\".\r\n- https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-io (event loop, TLS)\r\n- https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http\r\n- https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-mqtt\r\n- https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-compression\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nDespite the name they are not really AWS specific. Less \"all in one\" / more modular than libuv, but seem to cover similar ground, with more rigor, testing, documentation, and upstream activity. ",
