    "body": "### Problem\n\nHelpfully since https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/27717 neovim  reports fswatch errors. I indeed had one, namely that the numeric format of the latency argument was wrong, this is a feature and not a bug of fswatch as reported here https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch/issues/166. The argument in question is this one: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3c572a31a3bb7009b4ad8eac56da1458acae3b75/runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua#L281\r\n\r\nIn the past I've tried to fix it but somehow my `LC_NUMERIC` is still stuck on `nl_NL.UTF-8` which expects a latency argument of the format `0,5` instead of `0.5`.\r\n\r\nAn easy fix is to either start nvim with a working locale e.g. `env LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8 nvim <file>`, another is to add `env = { LC_NUMERIC = 'en_US.UTF-8' },` to the `opts` table of the `vim.system` call:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3c572a31a3bb7009b4ad8eac56da1458acae3b75/runtime/lua/vim/_watch.lua#L273\r\n\r\nI think there's a case to be made for adding the `env` table as it would make this functionality more robust and would prevent a source of confusion, but as you might figure from my locale woes I really wouldn't know what side-effects this would have. Adding the `env` table has worked for me though so far, I believe this local change is what causes the `dirty` in `nvim -v`.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`env LC_NUMERIC=nl_NL.UTF-8 nvim <file>`\r\n\r\nwhere `<file>` should be some file for which you've got an LSP installed and configured such that fswatch will start.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nI'd expect no error, but I don't know if this is reasonable as the problem is really on my side because I've got a misconfigured `LC_NUMERIC`.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-2521+g3c572a31a-dirty\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nno\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nOpenSuSE Tumbleweed\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nkonsole 23.08.4\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\ntmux-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nrepo",
