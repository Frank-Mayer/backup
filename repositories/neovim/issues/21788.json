    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nI like the new `statuscolumn` capability, and am trying to use it to produce a more cleanly-formatted status column.\r\n\r\nPrior the option's availablility, I used:\r\n\r\n* `set number`\r\n* `set relativenumber`\r\n* `set signcolumn=number`\r\n\r\nThis worked well, as lines would show a number *unless* there was a sign, in which case that sign would be overlaid in the number column instead. This saves horizontal space, and most numbers are still present (OK if you are just using them for navigation hints).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as best I can tell, there doesn't seem to be a way of replicating that behaviour with `statuscolumn`. The sign column `%s` format item allows for the sign to be shown, but there's no way to *test* whether a sign is present and conditionally return/show a line number. Possibly I could iterate over all signs in the document (not sure how to get them) but that seems horribly inefficient for something evaluated on every line/redraw.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'd be able to write code something like this:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n    _G.custom_statuscol = function()\r\n        if vim.v.has_signs\r\n            return \"%s\"\r\n        else\r\n            return vim.v.relnum\r\n        end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    vim.opt.statuscolumn = \"%{%v:lua.custom_statuscol()%}\"                                                                                                                    \r\n    vim.opt.relativenumber = true\r\n    vim.opt.number = true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new element in the code above that doesn't exist in the current featureset (as far as I know) is `vim.v.has_signs`.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the hard work on NeoVim!",
