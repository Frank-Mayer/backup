Then post that code because I haven't got any clue what you're talking about. It doesn't make sense to try to fit a curses interface into a space that's narrower than its minimum width, so I assume that isn't what you mean. And if you're talking about a table of descriptive notation, then that's just 8 lines of text which should behave as the previous example, so I assume that isn't what you mean either.\r\n\r\nHere's another way to think about it: say I run some commands via `:.!my-command` so the output ends up in the buffer. What do you expect to happen when the window is resized? /That/ is what is desired. Honestly, that's pretty much all that `acme` used to do, and all I really want is for `neovim` to be as powerful as `acme` was in 1995. For bonus points, imagine `:set nowrap`.",

            "body": "@josephholsten Yes; I know *what* these terminals do in those two simple examples. I don't know how they decide which things to do.\r\n\r\nLets pick a really simple case:\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"A\"x100\r\necho \"B\"x100\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe're expecting to see 100 \"A\"s, then 100 \"B\"s. On a terminal only 80 columns wide, this will spill over 4 lines in total - a line of 80 \"A\"s, then 20 more \"A\"s then the rest is blank. Then a line of 80 \"B\"s then 20 more \"B\"s and a remaining blank line. In total, 4 lines.\r\n\r\nNow make the terminal wider to, say, 90 columns. Lets guess what happens.\r\n\r\nYou and I both know (and can expect) that this means now we've got two lines of 90 characters each, followed by two lines of 10 remaining characters.\r\n\r\nBut how does the code know that? How does the code know, in the first of each pair of lines, that it has to steal those 10 filled characters from the start of the second of each pair of lines, and generally shuffle them around, but not to \"borrow\" 10 of the \"B\"s to fill in the gap at the end of the second line, where there used to be 20 \"A\"s and 60 blanks? It seems that for some lines of the terminal content, they have to steal the leading few cells of the following line in order to make them wider, but for other lines of the terminal they don't.\r\n\r\nThis clearly has something to do with whether 80->81st column spillover happened as a result of overstuffing of line line.\r\n\r\nWhat if instead we did\r\n\r\n```\r\necho \"A\"x80; echo \"A\"x20\r\necho \"B\"x80; echo \"B\"x20\r\n```\r\n\r\nVisually, the screen looks now identical to how it looked after the first script, but *now* when we expand this from 80 columns to 90, none of the lines have wrapped around at all; we keep all of them exactly as they were. Do we? Or do we reflow them anyway?\r\n\r\nAll of these examples have been the simplest possible things - no cursor moves, no edits, all entirely 100% just character prints. Imagine some much more complicated examples involving lots of cursor moves, deletes, inserts, scrolls etc... to create the history of what the content was. And now after all of that imagine trying to decide, per line of the screen, whether when making it wider it should steal characters from the start of the next line, or just be extended with blanks.\r\n\r\nCan you now write out those rules for me in English? Because I for one don't really have a clear idea of when and when not to.",

            "body": "@jamessan The iTerm2 link talks about \"continuation marks\". OK. that's a good discussion point.\r\n\r\nOn resize, we reflow or not any given line from its subsequent, depending on whether it has a continuation mark. That's an easy statement.\r\n\r\nNow can we list the rules for when we add or delete a continuation mark from a line?\r\n\r\nAttempting to demonstrate how this isn't so simple: lets imagine a sequence in which we move to a line (lets pick 10), clear the entire line, move to 79th column, print 3 letters (thus spilling around). Move back to 1st column of 10th line. Print three more. Now make wider - do we reflow this line? Did it still keep its continuation marker?\r\n\r\nOK what about: move to line 15. Print 100 characters (e.g. like the the `\"A\"x100` example above). Move to start of line 15 again. Erase to end of line. Print 30 characters then a linefeed. Now resize wider. What happens to those final 20 \"A\"s that ended up on line 16 - do they get reflowed into the end of line 15, as we would have done had we not done EL/30 more/LF? Or do they now not reflow?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me at least, the choice of whether-or-not to reflow on a given line is quite a complex and subtle question involving the previous edit history of both that line and those around it. I again invite someone to write down for me in English, the rules for deciding when to do this. Once we *have* some rules, it should be easy enough to go about implementing them.",

            "body": "I've been annoyed by this behavior for years now, so for the last few days I've been working on fixing it. I've lost important data that got truncated when I accidentally did a window split, and I've had to manually join together countless lines yanked from terminal windows. Well, at least things are a lot better than the old ConqueTerm days, as noble of an effort as that was...\r\n\r\nAnyways, my forks are here:\r\nhttps://github.com/zwegner/libvterm\r\nhttps://github.com/zwegner/neovim\r\n\r\nFor now, I'm working directly off the neovim fork of libvterm, but obviously it would be cool to get this merged in upstream libvterm eventually.\r\n\r\nI'm maybe about halfway done now. I have most of the basic reflowing working in libvterm, with only some minor modifications to neovim itself. There's still a few glitches, weird behavior, and unfinished parts (I'm completely ignoring double-width characters for now), so it's definitely not ready to be used yet. The whole libvterm test suite is passing (except for one single test, with a known fix), but plenty of new tests need to be written.\r\n\r\nImplementation notes for the nerdy:\r\n\r\nEach screen cell gets a \"wraparound\" attribute. This is only used for the first column in each row, but it's just one bit, and it fit nicely into the VTermScreenCellAttrs/ScreenPen bitfield (which was previously 15 bits), so it's stored for every screen cell. The bit is set when writing text causes a wraparound from the last to first column, and not from any CR/LF/etc characters. The bit is cleared when erasing the screen (either from internal scrolling activity, or from the erase ANSI codes). Printing normal characters will not overwrite the bit though, so if you have a long line wrap around, followed by a CR and some more text, it will remember the fact that the second is part of the first line. The rules are pretty simple now, but it's possible that some more logic will need to be added here to account for all the edge cases. When resizing the terminal, we check for this bit in the first column of each row of the old screen and join together lines, to be reflowed into the new screen geometry.\r\n\r\nI've had to modify the scrollback API for libvterm. Instead of passing one row's worth of cells each to neovim (or whatever library client), libvterm will now pass one *line's* worth of cells, or possibly a partial line if some of that line is visible on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe main important change in the libvterm API is that ownership of scrollback memory is now traded back and forth between libvterm and neovim. Previously, there was no sharing: libvterm would allocate a scrollback line, and would expect neovim to copy it into it's internal memory in the sb_pushline callback. Likewise, for a pop, libvterm would allocate one row's worth of memory, and expect neovim to fill it in. Since scrollback lines are arbitrarily sized now, libvterm can't allocate the memory up front for neovim to copy a line into (at least without providing another callback or something silly like that). So now, when scrolling, libvterm will allocate a scrollback line, and pass ownership of it to neovim through sb_pushline. After this, libvterm won't touch it anymore, and Neovim can do whatever with the line, until the next sb_popline. There, neovim passes control of the line back to libvterm, and can't touch it afterwards. One of the neovim changes I made for this was to use libvterm's allocator hooks, so that libvterm allocates all memory through neovim's APIs (xmalloc etc). Right now neovim and libvterm just use small wrappers around malloc(), but this ensures that the memory sharing will work if someone changes neovim's allocator.\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n* Write a bunch more tests. There's some hairy logic here, and I want this code to be 100% rock solid (as bad as losing some truncated terminal lines is now, having vim crash is way worse).\r\n* Support wide unicode characters properly (that is, don't split them across lines)\r\n* Make neovim aware of the new scrollback line structure when rendering: right now, if you print out long lines in a terminal, exit terminal mode, and scroll up, neovim will silently truncate each line at the rightmost column. This will involve some of the same problems as reflowing within libvterm, but presumably this is already solved somewhere else in vim (basically, how does vim flow text from a file?). I haven't yet looked into neovim enough to see if there's a clean way to use pre-existing text flow code here.\r\n* Optimize neovim's scrollback handling. At the very least, we should use a circular buffer for scrollback lines. It would probably make sense to adopt a block scheme like the one described in George Nachman's writeup on iTerm.\r\n* My libvterm git history has several revisions of ideas as I've fleshed out the implementation. It would probably make sense to squash some of them in a rebase to make reviewing easier.\r\n",

The rest of the logic isn't hard to write but until I have some clarity on the test cases, I can't write a full implementation to cover all of them.\r\n\r\nI started work at:\r\n\r\nhttps://blueprints.launchpad.net/libvterm/+spec/reflow-cases\r\n\r\nif you could take a look at those and run them through a few other example terminals you might have, and also provide any comment on whether they *should* reflow or not - as compared to whether they actually do. That's basically all I need - once I know what the behaviour ought to be then this is a simple enough change to write.\r\n\r\nOnce again in summary: the *required behaviour* is the complicated part here, not the code.

Right now I'm reflowing D as well, but as I said that logic might need some tweaking.\r\n\r\nIf these test cases are the main things you're concerned about, though, I think you might be underestimating the complication of properly dealing with wrapping and scrollback, especially when a scrollback line is partially visible.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of printing a 10000 character line in a 80x24 terminal, with the cursor on the next position after the end of the line. The cursor should be on column 0, as 10000 % 80 is 0. After resizing to 79x24, the cursor should be on column 10000%79=46, and so on. With the current scrollback scheme of fixed-length rows, handling this case correctly would be quite complicated, and probably very slow.\r\n\r\nHere are some properties that I think a reflowing solution must have:\r\n* The transition from the screen controlled by libvterm and the scrollback controlled by neovim should be absolutely seamless\r\n* After printing out any amount of pure text, with no control sequences, and any subsequent resizing to arbitrary geometries (assuming infinite scrollback), yanking the text in vim should give you the exact same sequence of bytes\r\n\r\nIf there's a way to accomplish this with significantly less complexity than what I have in the code, I'm all ears. But I doubt it. I will say again that my commits so far have several iterations of ideas that could be squashed together, and there's a few simplifications I can make as well. Overall though, the changes are really not that big. Here's a diffstat of all my commits, looking only at src/ and include/:\r\n` 6 files changed, 383 insertions(+), 126 deletions(-)`\r\nThat's less than 300 lines added, many of which are comments or debugging code.\r\n\r\n",

            "body": "Well, to make a long story short, I gave up on it. I greatly underestimated the complexity of having the \"correct\" behavior without weird edge cases and terrible performance in some situations.\r\n\r\nA rundown with (too much) more detail, in case anyone is interested:\r\n* Terminal reflow, as I was implementing it, requires row-wise scrolling. Otherwise when terminal lines that wrap around are scrolled off screen, the bottom row of the terminal will jump up leaving blank rows at the bottom, since vim/neovim can only show a partial line at the top if it's the only line on screen. In the worst case, after you run a shell command like `cat big_file_with_no_newlines.txt`, the next shell prompt will be the top line, and the entire output of `cat` will be scrolled off screen.\r\n* So, I spent a long time on row-wise scrolling (#11014). Like, a really long time, over a month's worth of full-time work. And this was really annoying, frustrating work. The vim codebase, with regards to the low-level text handling, is just... awful. So many years of cruft built up, with so little attention paid to having a sane architecture. There's so many options that affect rendering, and these options have influence over many of the lowest-level string handling operations. (Neovim is not much of an improvement in these respects, having mostly not touched this code, aside from removing the FEAT_* macros). The most basic version of row-wise scrolling was pretty easy to get going, but after that development got increasingly tedious, trying to debug all the weird corner cases.\r\n* And even if I could manage to untangle all the years of hacked together code and refactor it into a state that generally works (which I believe is still far away), the performance would be a major problem. Neo/vim's data structures are fundamentally tied to lines, always stored as contiguous bytes (I had plans to change this, and replace the data structures, but this is a *massive* amount of work). This has implications all over the place in the rendering system. Basically, when a line is scrolled off screen, the size of the line in screen columns needs to be computed, which invariably involves a linear scan of the entire line (and this scan itself is quite non-trivial, consisting of several functions, and lots of intertwined options). Even adding a cache to not run the same slow scan repeatedly on the same line would be quite non-trivial to get right.\r\n* Tying this back to terminal reflow, while slow performance with long lines would be acceptable for an opt-in standalone feature, it would be unacceptable IMO to have a huge performance regression for terminal use when the terminal program emits long lines. Likewise it would be unacceptable to force the non-row-wise scrolling jumping-prompt behavior described above on everyone. Making terminal reflow an option, so that reflow-but-with-bad-performance is opt-in, would be extremely complicated.\r\n* On a related note, the API between libvterm and neovim would get much more complicated. I thought about this a good amount, and it's still not clear to me how to make a clean interface to pass lines (not screen rows) back and forth between them, properly handling screen damage. My latest versions of both libvterm and neovim had a very ugly and inefficient API hacked together to get the right behavior.\r\n* So all in all, when finishing terminal reflow and row-wise scrolling meant lots more of my least-favorite kind of coding, all done for free, with questionable interest from the community, along with the prospect of trying to merge patches upstream to vim, and dealing with all the icky tradeoffs involved in these features, etc., it was really just not worth my time.\r\n* Looking back at my repo, I have a decent amount of unpublished work. I'm not sure what the exact status of it is, and it looks like a lot of my WIP is not in a publishable state. Honestly I don't even think it's worth anyone's time trying to continue this work. Vim is just broken.\r\n* Before completely giving up, when I still had plans to replace the neovim data structures, I started an experimental text editor backend using a new data structure that I believe is novel. I began building a basic text editor UI in Lua to test it, and quickly found that I was having much more fun without dealing with all the years of technical debt in neovim. Within a couple weeks, I had quite a few features, including row-wise scrolling using only O(log n) algorithms. I have the source here: https://github.com/zwegner/zmt. I've been sidetracked on several other things and haven't worked on it in a while, and it's a long way away from a usable text editor, but I have plans for several \"killer features\" that would be very difficult to implement in vim.",

We take the opportunities to collaborate with vim when such opportunities clearly exist, but uncertainty of what vim wants is _irrelevant_ when considering new features or heavy refactors. If a (future proposed) heavy refactor of the memline or displayline logic makes vim patches hard to merge, then so be it. Merging vim patches for features and bugfixes is surely useful, but If neovim dev is reduced to an exercise in constantly considering vim patch mergability, to the impediment of feature work, there is no point in having a separate codebase in the first place.

Might be worth looking into down the road if somebody wanted to take on that huge project...\r\n \r\n> I would be happy to take a look at your work. Even if we probably won't use much of it as-is, there likely will be ideas and design considerations we could derive from it. (if you don't want to be bothered with questions about it that is fine. Just us looking at the code is much better than throwing it all in the garbage bin, after all this time)\r\n\r\nAfter a night's rest, I think I was probably being a bit over-dramatic there :) I'm sure there's salvageable pieces in it, and it's probably worth having row-wise scrolling as an experimental feature, with possible glitches and bad performance.\r\n\r\nI'll try and clean things up enough to be presentable sometime soon. There's lots of small random changes I have that I can't remember the purpose of, which could be confusing...\r\n\r\n> To be clear (to any one else potentially interested) interaction with upstream vim in any direction is _never_ any sort of requirement when doing feature work on neovim. We take the opportunities to collaborate with vim when such opportunities clearly exist, but uncertainty of what vim wants is _irrelevant_ when considering new features or heavy refactors. If a (future proposed) heavy refactor of the memline or displayline logic makes vim patches hard to merge, then so be it. Merging vim patches for features and bugfixes is surely useful, but If neovim dev is reduced to an exercise in constantly considering vim patch mergability, to the impediment of feature work, there is no point in having a separate codebase in the first place.\r\n\r\nRight--I shouldn't have implied otherwise. You and Justin were both clear that diverging is OK. Even so, it still weighed on my mind, mostly in trying to structure commits/branches to make them more easily upstream-able, or thinking that somebody would want help integrating them into vim.",
