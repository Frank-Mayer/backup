Right now, the `file-line` plugin has to rather messily hook `BufferRead` and `BufferNew`... and ends up bumping into issues [like this](https://github.com/bogado/file-line/pull/24) as a result. Some means of hooking in before a file read is attempted seems cleanest. Or alternatively, don't provide any hook and just go with the GNU standard for now (the number of error formats should really be small, ~1):~~\n\n_Edit_: this hook already exists. Thanks to @fmoralesc - see comments below\n\nReference the [GNU coding standards on error messages](http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Errors)\n",

Attempting `:line,col` actually gives the same result as `:col`, setting the column position to `1`.

It is still maintained (last commit was 3 weeks ago).\r\n\r\nIn addition to supporting `nvim file.cpp:xx[:yy]`, it also supports `:e file.cpp:xx[:yy]` and `gF` on strings matching such a path as well.\r\n\r\nWith regards to whether there is a spec or not, vim-fetch refers to `file.cpp[:ll[:cc]]` \"the gnu colon format\", though this representation is certainly not exclusive to GNU. If you generalize it to only line numbers it's pretty much universal across tools/editors on all active platforms today.",
