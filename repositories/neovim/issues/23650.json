While debugging I found out that when this happens, there's also a rapid deletion and creation of `/tmp/wl-copy-buffer-xxxx` directories happening at the same time. \r\n\r\nCuriously, this only happens when the netrw banner is turned **off**.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\ncd /tmp\r\nnvim --clean\r\n\r\n:set clipboard=unnamedplus\r\n:Explore\r\n<I>   # press 'I' to disable the banner in netrw\r\n```\r\n\r\nObserve how the curser starts to flicker and the CPU usage goes up considerably. When in `/tmp`,  you should see a directory called `wl-copy-buffer-xxxx` being rapidly created and deleted with a new suffix -- probably causing this issue.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nCPU load should not increase when the banner is turned off, and the cursor should not flicker as well.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.7.2, confirmed also with latest nighly\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nyes, 9.0\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nDebian\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\ngnome-terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\napt",
