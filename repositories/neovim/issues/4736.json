Apparently caused by very inefficient highlighting (slow regexps?).\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nCursor movement at normal speed (i.e. without getting stuck indefinitely).\r\n### Steps to reproduce using `nvim -u NORC`\r\n\r\n```\r\nnvim -u NORC englishdictionary.sql\r\n```\r\n\r\nVim behavior is the same, i.e. bad.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I'm raising this issue is to propose some timeout for highlighting. I'm working quite a lot with such long-line files and it's pain without highlighting and even more with it.\r\n\r\nEven some hack as switching off highlighting for lines longer than some configurable _N_ would be fine, because my goal is to edit the file and work with it (and with the indefinitely hung nvim it's impossible to run `:syntax off`).\r\n",

Bram sketched out a design in a recent [vim_dev thread](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/vim_dev/qtw5LdCrHJQ/aOeysSR0DgAJ):\n\n```\n> > > Can we make it work with vim commands?

But storing the state of what screen lines still \nneed to be colored, and making sure the coloring is interrupted by a \ntyped character, is still some work. And when it takes long it also \nrequires timers to be invoked... \n```\n",

[Relevant issue](https://groups.google.com/g/vim_dev/c/YH1NUgWGBIg?pli=1)\r\n\r\nI literally cannot edit the file and each action takes a few minutes. I'm using latest nightly Neovim. (Unfortunately) VS Code is completely fine and I can jump around/navigate through the file without any issues (even with the Vim extension). Turning `syntax off` solved the issue, but ofc this is not a solution.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any details, I can provide anything I can (although, it looks like the issue will never be addressed)",
