This would help in writing clean and slightly more robust code that's not filled with string literals like `'textDocument\\codeAction'`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThis set of constants could then be used internally in this codebase, and could also be included in `vim.lsp.protocol` so that external users could use it in their configurations and plugins.",
