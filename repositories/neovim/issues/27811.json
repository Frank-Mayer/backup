    "body": "I will be working on an ext_cmdline/message implementation for the TUI. An internal C implementation was explored first, but dropped after coming to the conclusion that properly untangling the current cmdline from the message grid in C would require more work than leveraging and improving the already existing parallel ext_ code path.\r\n\r\n**Goals/progress:**\r\n- [ ] Implement a floating window in the cmdline area that mimics the current cmdline. Should allow us to verify there are no regressions.\r\n\t- [x] Allow floating window in cmdline area(#27687).\r\n\t- [ ] Add treesitter highlighting.\r\n- [ ] Initially also place messages in a floating window in the cmdline area for the same reason.\r\n\t- [x] Allow non-zero 'cmdheight' with ext_messages(#27812). Not currently possible which seems like an arbitrary restriction. In my opinion, a final implementation could still have the cmdline in the current 'cmdheight'-affected area, but:\r\n\t- [ ] Messages should be placed elsewhere eventually, eliminating the hit-enter-prompt.\r\n\t- [ ] Move mode, ruler and showcmd to the cmdline floating window.\r\n\t- [ ] Propagate highlight group id's instead of attrs for all messages(#27813). Initially started with this because it was necessary for the internal C implementation. Finished it because it is more useful for ext_message consumers.\r\n- [ ] Remove redundant C components:\r\n\t- [ ] Unmaintained Vimscript parser and cmdline highlighter.\r\n\t- [ ] Message grid.",
