    "body": "### Problem\n\nI want to set some filetypes to be backup-ed. And other filetypes to keep their original. But backupskip applies universaly to backup and patchmode. The same for backupdir. (it would be nice to have a folder with my backup files while patchmoded .orig stay in the original folder.)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nI have two files: an `example1.conf  `and an `example2.text`\r\n\r\nSetting backup will create an `example.conf.bak` and an `example.text.bak` (or `example1.conf~` and `example2.text~` as per the original behavior.)\r\n\r\nSetting `patchmode` will create `example1.conf.orig` and `example2.text.orig` respectively.\r\n\r\nGiven my aim is to have `example1.conf.orig` and `example2.text.bak`,\r\n\r\nI read the `:h` on `backupskip`.\r\n\r\nBut (if I understand :h correctly,) `backupskip` applies both to `vim.opt.backup` and `vim.opt.patchmode`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, if I was to add the extension `*.conf` to `backupskip`, I would end up with no example1 backup or original, and example2.text.bak along with an exampl2.orig\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nHaving a `patchmodeskip` and `patchmodedir` would make for a clean solution to this.\r\n\r\nI believe a solution could be devised with autocommands, but I am (rightfully?) reluctant to apply hacky solutions to the save-your-ass functionality that is a backup. It is supposed to to work when everything else fails, after all. In my mind (maybe I am wrong,) autocommandds would compromise it.",
