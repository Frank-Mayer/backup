    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\n- `nvim --version`: nvim 0.4.4\r\n- `vim -u DEFAULTS` (version: ) behaves differently?\r\n- Operating system/version: Debian 10 Buster 64bit (in VMWare / Windows 10 host)\r\n- Terminal name/version: terminator 1.92-1\r\n- `$TERM`: xterm-256color\r\n\r\nI have a setup where unfortunately interacting with X clipboard is slow, both `xsel` and `xclip` shows a one second delay:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ntime xclip -o -selection clipboard\r\n#foobar\r\n#\r\n#real\t0m1.047s\r\n#...\r\ntime xsel -o -b\r\n#foobar\r\n#\r\n#real\t0m1.070s\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause of the test in `runtime/autoload/provider/clipboard.vim`, using `xsel` as clipboard provider adds a 1s penalty to boot time. The recommended fix so far is to use `xclip`, which indeed works for that problems but introduces other problems (clipboards sync issues). Hence I'd like to stick to `xsel` (another fix pointed by @bfredl is to remove all occurrences of `has('clipboard')` from vim.ini).\r\n\r\nThe following change was introduced in commit 695703ca97e9330e3dbbeb3153b57b4ca565d045 in 2017 to fix an issue in xsel, and fallback to xclip:\r\n\r\n``` diff\r\n-  elseif exists('$DISPLAY') && executable('xsel')\r\n+  elseif exists('$DISPLAY') && executable('xsel') && s:cmd_ok('xsel -o -b')\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in 2018, `xclip` has been promoted, and is selected before `xsel` (commit 799d9c32157c841c3b8d355fa98a5ace435eef07):\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n-  elseif exists('$DISPLAY') && executable('xsel') && s:cmd_ok('xsel -o -b')\r\n-    let s:copy['+'] = 'xsel --nodetach -i -b'\r\n-    let s:paste['+'] = 'xsel -o -b'\r\n-    let s:copy['*'] = 'xsel --nodetach -i -p'\r\n-    let s:paste['*'] = 'xsel -o -p'\r\n-    return 'xsel'\r\n   elseif exists('$DISPLAY') && executable('xclip')\r\n     let s:copy['+'] = 'xclip -quiet -i -selection clipboard'\r\n     let s:paste['+'] = 'xclip -o -selection clipboard'\r\n     let s:copy['*'] = 'xclip -quiet -i -selection primary'\r\n     let s:paste['*'] = 'xclip -o -selection primary'\r\n     return 'xclip'\r\n+  elseif exists('$DISPLAY') && executable('xsel') && s:cmd_ok('xsel -o -b')\r\n+    let s:copy['+'] = 'xsel --nodetach -i -b'\r\n+    let s:paste['+'] = 'xsel -o -b'\r\n+    let s:copy['*'] = 'xsel --nodetach -i -p'\r\n+    let s:paste['*'] = 'xsel -o -p'\r\n+    return 'xsel'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a result, the test on `xsel -o -b` is \"less\" necessary, and I would like to propose to remove it, ie. revert commit 695703ca97e9330e3dbbeb3153b57b4ca565d045, so that to fix the 1s boot delay. If there are concerns over `xsel` over alternatives like `lemonade`, maybe `xsel` could be demoted further. In any case, I think that, in practice, if xsel is available on the system, we should assume that it works correctly and the `xsel -o -b` test was more of a temporary fix.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time and great app!\r\nMichaÃ«l\r\n",
