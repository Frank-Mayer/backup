I will try the latest master later today and try to make proper steps to reproduce, but I thought I would create this issue first in case anyone already knows what might cause this.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nFor now, printing the changes reported by `on_changedtree` (maybe with a higher line number and possibly some injected language, since I am not sure what causes this yet) should make the bug show up.\r\n\r\nI will try to write proper reproduction steps later tonight. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nReport the correct line numbers for the change as a few weeks ago. \r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.10.0 commit 3f188bc (update: tried commit d994600, and still see the bug)\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nmacOS 14.2.1\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nwezterm\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nbuild from repo",
