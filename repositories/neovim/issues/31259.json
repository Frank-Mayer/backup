I would like to be disable them, and rebind them all manually. This would also prevent accidentally pressing keys whose function is unknown.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nA Lua function like vim.keymap.disableDefault() could be used for this, alternatively there could be a function that deleted all previously set keybinds, including by a config file or default.",
