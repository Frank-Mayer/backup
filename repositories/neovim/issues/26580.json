    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n`:checkhealth` doesn't work for plugins that have been installed using luarocks and added to the `package.path` and the runtimepath.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this is that the [`copy_directories` field cannot include a \"lua\" directory](https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/wiki/Rockspec-format), as it has a special meaning (installed to `lib`, instead of `share`)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA potential solution would be to search the `package.path` in the [`get_healthcheck_list`](https://github.com/mrcjkb/neovim-fork/blob/ef38fdfdc6c84abd8ce7be02eaf8edc91ebc7917/runtime/lua/vim/health.lua#L76) function:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlocal lua_lib_path = package.searchpath(p .. '.health', package.path)\r\nif lua_lib_path then\r\n  table.insert(paths, lua_lib_path)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if this would have any negative implications, or if there's a better way to solve this, which is why I'm opening this issue for discussion before I open a PR :smile: ",
