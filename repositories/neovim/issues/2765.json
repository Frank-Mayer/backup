Lack of color support is not great, but the main issue is that :! is running a _blocking_ command, while :terminal opens a new buffer with a terminal and the code that launched it keeps running.\nMany plugins(and my vimrc) relies on :! for running an external command then then processing the output, and that currently breaks in neovim. And because of the blocking nature of :!, it is not replaceable with :terminal.\n\nAs an additional note, regarding opening :term in a new tab as a workaround to \"current window getting closed\". This is also not valid for all use cases of :! in vim. Currently I use fzf.vim to open an fzf-list of all completions, from command line mode. If I try this in nvim, it breaks, since it's not valid to open a new tab from command line mode. It is, however, valid in vim to launch an interactive process with :! from command line mode, and hence it works fine there(and is very useful)\n",

This is the only way the bang commands will be consistent across UIs, so programs designed to be used interactively from the terminal will no longer work from inside nvim.\r\n\r\nThis does not explicitely state WONTFIX, but it describes the current behavior as intentional, so that's how I took it. I had read most, but not all, other comments in the thread (as github hid some of them due to being too many), and failed to notice it was later stated that there is a plan to fix it in 0.5.0, in a way that addresses both interactivity and ANSI escapes (as you say, by making it a full fledged terminal).

This could still be done with pipes: we'd need something to interpret the ANSI escapes in the output of the pipe in order to display the colored text.\r\n\r\nI see this expressed several times during this discussion, but it's wrongheaded; the request here is to interpret the output of commands _less_, not more. Currently nvim is actively finding and pretty-printing \"non-printable\" characters. If instead it didn't modify the string at all before printing it, things would work as expected by OP. As proof, here's a workaround:\r\n\r\n```vim\r\n\r\n:let x=system('echo -e ''\\033]52;c;''; base64; echo -e ''\\007''', \"It works!\")\r\n:echo x\r\n:lua function rawecho(x) io.stderr:write(x) end\r\n:lua rawecho(x)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first echo shows `^[]52;c;SXQgd29ya3Mh^G` with `^[` and `^G` in a bold grey font (to indicate they've been escaped, presumably). The \"raw\" echo places `It works!` into the terminal's copy buffer (for most terminals).\r\n\r\nIf it's too late to amend nvim echo to pretty-print less, this should at least be noted in vim_diff.txt.\r\n\r\n---\r\nP.S.\r\n\r\nA viml version of \"raw echo\", which also functions as a workaround for #2765:\r\n\r\n```vim\r\n\" Echo a string to the terminal without munging the escape sequences.\r\nfunction! g:Rawecho (str)\r\n  call writefile([a:str], '/dev/fd/2', 'b')\r\nendfunction\r\n```",
