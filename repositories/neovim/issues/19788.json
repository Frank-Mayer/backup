Can you try the development version?\r\n> \r\n>     * The [Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) page has pre-built archives for Linux/Windows/macOS.\r\n> \r\n>     * Check `:version` to confirm that you are using the latest version.\r\n\r\nSorry, I've not used nvim recently. I pulled down the nightly anyways to check. It works better but still not great with pyenv-win.\r\n\r\n1. Download nvim\r\n2. Have pyenv-win installed\r\n3. Create a new environment (`pyenv duplicate 3.10.11 nvim`)\r\n4. Set the current shell interpreter to it (`pyenv shell nvim`)\r\n5. Check that it is correct (`pyenv vname` returns \"nvim\")\r\n6. Install pynvim to the nvim environment (`pyenv exec python -m pip install pynvim`)\r\n7. Run nvim (`nvim --clean`)\r\n8. `:checkhealth`\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3 provider (optional) ~\r\n- pyenv: Path: C:\\Users\\Ross\\.pyenv\\pyenv-win\\bin\\pyenv.BAT\r\n- pyenv: Root: C:\\Users\\Ross\\.pyenv\\pyenv-win\\\r\n- `g:python3_host_prog` is not set.  Searching for python3 in the environment.\r\n- WARNING pyenv is not set up optimally.\r\n  - ADVICE:\r\n    - Create a virtualenv specifically for Nvim using pyenv, and set `g:python3_host_prog`.  This will avoid the need to install the pynvim module in each version/virtualenv.\r\n- ERROR \"C:\\Users\\Ross\\.pyenv\\pyenv-win\\versions\\nvim\\python3.exe\r\n\" was not found.\r\n- Executable: Not found\r\n- ERROR Detected pip upgrade failure: Python executable can import \"pynvim\" but not \"neovim\": python3\r\n  - ADVICE:\r\n    - Use that Python version to reinstall \"pynvim\" and optionally \"neovim\".\r\n      python3 -m pip uninstall pynvim neovim\r\n      python3 -m pip install pynvim\r\n      python3 -m pip install neovim  # only if needed by third-party software\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems to be something with how pyenv-win sets the executable maybe? It seems to have carriage return in it. It still seems to detect something but not quite something that is correct. It does the same thing if I set the interpreter as the global interpreter or the local interpreter instead of shell.\r\n\r\nIf I do not set a global python interpreter (I normally do not have one set as I do not like global state) nvim python detection doesn't work at all but that is mostly expected, it tries to run a global python but one doesn't exist. I'm not sure what happens on Linux if pyenv doesn't have a Python set when you run nvim.\r\n\r\nObviously if I set `g:python3_host_prog` it works fine. It's been a while, but I think that means it works better. As if I recall correctly it didn't work before even with that set. I'll open an issue on the pyenv-win repo to see if there's something on their end that can be done regarding the carriage return.",
