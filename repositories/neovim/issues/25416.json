    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nLua functions added during a development cycle are not considered stable and may change at any time before the release, not just in behavior but in name (or may vanish again altogether). However, it is not obvious from the documentation if a function is still unstable or already part of the public API (in which case renaming or removing have to go through a deprecation process). This means that you can often find them used in plugins, with the obvious effects whenever they are changed. (Prerelease versions should only be used for testing and developing, not productive use, but that's a different topic.)\r\n\r\nThis is different from the Nvim API, which has `NVIM_API_PRERELEASE` annotations.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWe should explicitly mark newly-added Lua functions as \"unstable\" in the documentation. As the documentation is automatically generated from docstrings, so should this be.\r\n\r\nThe simplest approach would be to add an `--- @unstable` annotation and convert this in `gen_vimdoc` to a friendly (but clear) warning; as part of the release process, these annotations would then have to be removed. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could integrate the Lua API into our general API versioning (without the strong contract about not removing functions before 2.0, of course) and use the same `NVIM_API` annotations for them (including `FUNC_API_SINCE`, `FUNC_API_DEPRECATED_SINCE`, etc.?) so we could use the same automation as for the C documentation. This would imply (not necessarily, but in practice), that the API version would be bumped at each minor release instead of the first time an `nvim_foo` API function is added.\r\n\r\nThis would probably be a bit more work to set up, but versioning the Lua API is something we'll need to do for Nvim 1.0 anyway, and there's no reason we can't start earlier.
