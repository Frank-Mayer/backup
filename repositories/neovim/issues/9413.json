    "body": "I'm not sure if the issue tracker is the right place for this, please close if it isn't.\r\n\r\nThe [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) package manager allows users to install (neo-)vim with plugins. Currently, the user will then have to manually call `UpdateRemotePlugins`. I would like to fix that by providing a system `rplugin.vim`.\r\n\r\nHowever I don't want to completely override the user rplugin.vim. That would be confusing for the user who may have additional plugins installed manually. So I want\r\n\r\n- `UpdateRemotePlugins` to work as before\r\n- both the system `rplugin.vim` and the user `rplugin.vim` to be read\r\n\r\nOne possible approach would be to set `NVIM_RPLUGIN_MANIFEST` to point to the system manifest, which then has `source stdpath('data') . '/rplugin.vim')` as its last line. That will break `UpdateRemotePlugins` however and will likely fail because neovim throws an exception when the same plugin is registered twice.\r\n\r\nInstead I am now experimenting with patching neovim like this:\r\n\r\n```patch\r\ndiff --git a/runtime/autoload/remote/host.vim b/runtime/autoload/remote/host.vim\r\nindex 6266b312b..965fabf1e 100644\r\n--- a/runtime/autoload/remote/host.vim\r\n+++ b/runtime/autoload/remote/host.vim\r\n@@ -71,7 +71,8 @@ function! remote#host#RegisterPlugin(host, path, specs) abort\r\n \r\n   for plugin in plugins\r\n     if plugin.path == a:path\r\n-      throw 'Plugin \"'.a:path.'\" is already registered'\r\n+      \" plugin already registered\r\n+      return\r\n     endif\r\n   endfor\r\n \r\ndiff --git a/runtime/plugin/rplugin.vim b/runtime/plugin/rplugin.vim\r\nindex 122d8d47f..83fbf8b57 100644\r\n--- a/runtime/plugin/rplugin.vim\r\n+++ b/runtime/plugin/rplugin.vim\r\n@@ -54,6 +54,10 @@ function! s:GetManifest() abort\r\n endfunction\r\n \r\n function! s:LoadRemotePlugins() abort\r\n+  if exists('$NVIM_SYSTEM_RPLUGIN_MANIFEST')\r\n+    let g:system_remote_plugins = fnamemodify($NVIM_SYSTEM_RPLUGIN_MANIFEST, ':p')\r\n+    execute 'source' fnameescape(g:system_remote_plugins)\r\n+  endif\r\n   let g:loaded_remote_plugins = s:GetManifest()\r\n   if filereadable(g:loaded_remote_plugins)\r\n     execute 'source' fnameescape(g:loaded_remote_plugins)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that patch, I can set `NVIM_SYSTEM_RPLUGIN_MANIFEST` and have the behaviour I want. I generate the system manifest with\r\n\r\n```\r\n    NVIM_RPLUGIN_MANIFEST=system-rplugin.vim nvim -N -u systemrc.vim -i NONE -n -E -s +UpdateRemotePlugins +quit!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs that a bad idea for some reason? Would there be interest to upstream some version of this?\r\n",
