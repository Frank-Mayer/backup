I'm guessing that the long-term goal would be to replace the old tests with lua/busted tests, so all tests use the same approach. \r\n\r\nI'm a long-time vim user, but am new to contributing to vim, so I'd be happy to help with this, if there is interest. I did a little experiment with a single test, and I'll attach a PR shortly.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThis is more of a project than a single issue, but I think the desired end state is that the `test/old` directory is deleted after all the tests are moved to `test/funtional` or similar.",
