I know that I can just \\<C-L\\> and screen will redraw, it does not work in AstroNvim, and anyway it's uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n![issue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33931619/211409457-60899bcd-cf25-44e5-9ac3-57ba8f318144.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun nvim with configured LSP and try to complete code, or create buffers like NerdTree or NeoTree.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI really expect there to be no visual artifacts.\r\n\r\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\r\n\r\n0.8.1\r\n\r\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\r\n\r\ncan't say, didn't configured vim so I can't see if it behaves same\r\n\r\n### Operating system/version\r\n\r\nWindows 11, ArchLinux with WSL2\r\n\r\n### Terminal name/version\r\n\r\nWindows Terminal\r\n\r\n### $TERM environment variable\r\n\r\nxterm=256color\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\npacman",

I am using Windows 10 19044.2486\r\n2.  I am running NixOS in WLS2\r\n3.  I have tried multiple terminal emulators that are *natively installed* on Windows, and engage with WSL from there.  Even with WSLg, GUI apps (even terminal emulators) are a pain in the butt.  Emulators tried are Windows Terminal, Alacritty and WezTerm.\r\n4.  I have tried both Neovim 8.0.1 and 8.0.2.\r\n5.  I have tried launching Neovim with `nvim --clean` and reproduced the glitchiness\r\n\r\nThe glitches don't always happen right away but they happen consistently every time and are pretty distracting.  Entering CTRL-L clears them and cleans things up but the littering shortly resumes thereafter .\r\n\r\nWays I have been able to create the litter/artifacts:\r\n1. Mouse scrolling in the built in terminal or toggle term\r\n2. Using LSP hovers\r\n3. Simply moving the cursor over top of hover effects like indent-blankline and lsp stuff\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking in my case it looks like the boundaries of the application are ignored and the text is dropped into the leftmost boundary of the emulator.\r\n\r\nImages:\r\n![visualglitch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28788713/217396802-49687653-6764-4c2a-b83d-a8980db34db7.PNG)\r\n![visualglitch1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28788713/217396805-18711e81-938f-480f-8371-aea00c22b940.PNG)\r\n![visualglitch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28788713/217396807-d7c35f7a-a98c-4b3b-bcbd-06a52fc7d4dc.PNG)\r\n\r\n",
