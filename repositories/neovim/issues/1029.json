If you hit 'K' on a identifier without a man page for example, you will only know that because the screen flickers and doesn't show the man page to you.\n\nThis patch basically is only to demonstrate that it is (easily?) possible to change the behavior. Further discussion is advised though. Making the behavior configurable would be an idea (I lean towards not interrupting the workflow with a pause and message in any case).\n",

Just using another shell is just as easy and is exactly equivalent (except that you may have to open a new shell or change to an open one).\n\nThis proposed behavior fits very well in my workflow so I am all for it.

Isn't the issue more that the plugin uses (or has to use?) an unadapted mechanism to execute commands? Or that it doesn't handle errors properly?\n\nAs a user facing feature the prompt is not nonsense for everyone. Some people do use this feature, so I don't think it should be completely removed. An option to configure this behaviour seems like a good idea. I personally don't mind about the default value for the option. I think it depends on the neovim policy chosen for the new defaults. Backward compatibility would suggest keeping the default behaviour similar to vim; user friendly defaults would lean toward skipping the prompt all the time or when nothing was output.\n\nPersonally I'd be fine with a 'user friendly' default for this. 'Advanced' users will know to look for \":help\" when something doesn't work as they expect after switching to neovim. As for plugins, they should have a way to handle errors properly without having to modify the behaviour of user facing commands.\n",

Setting `cmdheight` prior to calling `vim.api.nvim_echo()` with the intent to reset it post-echo didn't seem to help. Based on the information in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16462, I wrote the following function that truncates the middle section of the message in order to display a message that has some start/end context and also doesn't elicit the forsaken 'Press ENTER or type command to continue'.\r\n```lua\r\nlocal test_message = \"This long message will not display on a single line on most screens. If it does, ensure your window size is smaller.\"\r\n\r\nlocal function non_disruptive_echo(message)\r\n    if #message > vim.v.echospace then\r\n        local trunc_fill = \"...\"\r\n        local first_part = string.sub(message, 1, vim.v.echospace/2 - #trunc_fill)\r\n        local second_part = string.sub(message, #message - math.floor((vim.v.echospace/2)), #message)\r\n        vim.api.nvim_echo({{first_part .. trunc_fill .. second_part}}, false, {})\r\n    else\r\n        vim.api.nvim_echo({{message}}, false {})\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n\r\nnon_disruptive_echo(test_message)\r\n```\r\nOutput on a very small window: `This long messag...dow size is smaller.`\r\n\r\nIt would be really good to have an option to disable the 'Press ENTER...' prompt when using `vim.api.nvim_echo()` and still display the full string to be echoed.",
