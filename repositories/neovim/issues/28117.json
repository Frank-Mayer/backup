Also it is confusing to have `TSEditQuery` and `EditQuery` both to edit TS queries (I guess one is persistent and the other not. Which is also not obvious from the names)\r\n\r\nDiscoverability of commands is usually good and seems very important especially as more complex features such as LSP and Treesitter become native. For treesitter it is not the case. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nHave explicit name with consistent prefix\r\nFor example\r\nTSPlaygroundQuery\r\nTSPlaygroundInspect\r\nTSPlaygroundInspectTree\r\nIt could be TSDebugQuery etc. \r\nOr TSLiveQuery TSLiveInspect TSLiveInspectTree\r\nOr whatever else you can come up with.\r\nMaybe old commands should be kept as aliases.",

            "body": "> reading :h treesitter is not optional if you want to do anything with it.\r\n\r\nOk but I feel like we cannot always assume that everyone read everything (e.g 1423 lines of help page for treesitter) so it can always help to improve UX and make things a bit more discoverable. At least that was my point but I understand we won't change the name of the commands that's fine.\r\nYes I read help pages a lot but no it's not mutually exclusive with design helping discoverability. That's the reason why commands such as :Edit exist otherwise we literally just have :1 :2 :3 and then remember every command by heart.\r\n\r\n> Then you should learn how to search the help documents. It's a very valuable skill. (Check out :helpgrep.)\r\n\r\nEven with the help grep I still don't know how to find a command. As I said commands in the help page starts with a \":\" but there is also like a hundred unrelated things (such as function signature and link to unrelated functions such as :write) in the document. I am sure you and other experienced people know how to do this but I do not know even after reading `:help grep`.\r\nGood UX needs people that understand that most people are not as knowledgeable as the one regularly contributing to the application. Good UX cannot assume that it's always the user's fault if he's lost.  Even though as Neovim is for devs we can still assume informed users doing their research of course but there's limits and good UX can help.\r\n\r\n> Also, there's tab-complete for commands.\r\n\r\nMy point is if there's one common prefix such as :TSInspectTree and :TSEditQuery I can use tab complete like :TS<tab> to find commands. I do not know if I can use tab-complete when I do not know what to search for because I have no prefix. And as I said vim.treesitter.<tab> gives me all API functions instead of user commands. Two separate things.\r\n",

We _don't_ want to make treesitter into a separate subsystem with a common prefix -- same reason we don't have a bunch of `:LSPfoo` commands. (We _do_ have this on the \"API\" level, which users _are_ expected to interact with. Commands are just some slight convenience sugar on top of it, for some things that don't rely heavily on arguments.)\r\n\r\nThe issue here is that you came in with a preconceived expectation from a separate plugin; but Neovim itself has a different UX paradigm.",
