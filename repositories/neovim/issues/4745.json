            "body": "> converting magic to a string from a boolean\n\nThat would break plugins.\n\n> configurable and saveable \n\nNever set `'nomagic'`. It will break many plugins, including built-in such as netrw. `'magic'` is a basic assumption. I would rather propose we _remove_ the option than add extra functionality to it.\n\nYou can map `nnoremap / /\\v` if you really want searches to always be \"very magic\". But I don't recommend it, for [this reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/374pxy/moving_up_the_36_chambers_of_vim_entered_the/crjo512), repeated below:\n\n---\n\n`'magic'` is actually a good balance once you get used to abusing `/` as a workhorse for quick-and-dirty motion. Think about it: `.*^$[]` are really useful, but most of the time you want everything _else_ to be literal. \n- The default (\"magic\") mode should be thought of as: only a few _commonly-used_ special chars are considered special. This is for quick-and-dirty work. `.*^$[]` are very commonly needed when searching, so they are considered special by default \"magic\".\n  - It's somewhat annoying that `+()` are not special, but again, `+` is a special case of `*` and `()` are for grouping, so this is beyond the common case. \n  - The idea of `'magic'` is that you _usually_ want `/` to do a _literal_ search (except for the workhorse `$^[].*` functions).\n- Any time you're doing real work, use `\\v` (\"very magic\"). Everything that can be special, is special.\n\nWhen in doubt, just plop a `\\v` at the front of your expression.\n\n```\n:g/\\vfoo+/d\n```\n",
