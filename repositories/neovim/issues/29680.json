If I don't do this, neovim can't find them. Potentially related to #27951. I do have nvim-treesitter installed, but even if I install the bundled parsers using the plugin, I still get the same error when opening a file.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n```\r\nmake CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\r\nsudo make install\r\nnvim xxx.lua\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNeovim should be able to find the parsers in the location its build system installs them to.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nv0.10.0\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nVoid Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nWindows Terminal\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nxterm-256color\n\n### Installation\n\nbuild from repo",
