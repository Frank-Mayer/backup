    "body": "### Problem\n\nWe would like to display the intro screen in Neovide to for example make sure that the donation and sponsor links are displayed, and that we honor Bram's wishes. See https://github.com/neovide/neovide/issues/620\r\n\r\nBut there are two problems, the intro screen is closed as soon as the window is redrawn. That is problematic because we don't know the final size at the time of `nvim_ui_attach`, the number of rows can change due to `guifont` and other settings that are applied during the startup.\r\n\r\nOne idea I had, is to add an auto command that runs at `VimEnter`  and calls `intro` when there's only one buffer and it does not have any text. While I think that it works, I think it would be better if Neovim did that automatically.\r\n\r\nThe second problem is that it doesn't actually work with `--multigrid`. The text is displayed behind the main window and only \"press ENTER or type command to continue\" is visible. The message is displayed in grid 1, while grid 2 is on top, both with floating order `None`  in Neovide we interpret this as the highest id is on top.\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. create a configuration that sets the guifont\r\n2. launch neovide --multigrid\r\n3. Observe that no intro screen is displayed\r\n4. run `:intro`\r\n5. Observe that the intro screen is rendered behind the buffer\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nThe intro screen should show.\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\n0.9.1\n\n### Vim (not Nvim) behaves the same?\n\nN/A\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Terminal name/version\n\nNeovide\n\n### $TERM environment variable\n\nalacritty\n\n### Installation\n\npacman",
