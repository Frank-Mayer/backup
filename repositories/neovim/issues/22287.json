It's not easy for clients to generate their own language-specific interface to the Nvim Lua stdlib (`vim.*`, `:help lua-stdlib`).\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nWe have started to annotate the Lua stdlidb with LuaLS ~~EmmyLua~~ type hints. We could use this to ~~generate something like `:help api-metadata` and expose it as a secondary tree via `nvim_get_api_info()` and `nvim --api`.~~ Or alternatively, just ship a `luameta.lua` or `luameta.mpack` file in the runtime files, which can be loaded by clients to generate their wrappers.\r\n\r\n- [x] ship `foo.mpack` files (currently undocumented but they live in `runtime/doc/*.mpack`)\r\n- [x] ship LuaLS annotations in `runtime/lua/vim/_meta` for quasi-introsopection. [#19918](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/19918)\r\n- [ ] ship util function that makes it easy for plugins to consume LuaLS annotations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n- Benefits\r\n    - Clearly answers the question of where new functionality should go:\r\n        - API (libnvim) = expose low-level things that are otherwise limited to internal usage.\r\n        - Lua stdblib = high-level functionality that builds on top of the API.\r\n        - Related: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20451\r\n- Costs\r\n    - Lua is less natural to use for C clients linking to `libnvim`.\r\n    - Eventually, this would imply that the Lua stdlib has a strong contract like `:help api-contract`, since this would mean that RPC clients now depend on the Lua stdlib. Thus it would be harder to evolve the Lua stdlib.\r\n        - Mitigation: mechanism for marking Lua functions as \"experimental\" (or just \"mental\" ;).\r\n",
