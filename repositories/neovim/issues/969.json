A couple of loose points in no particular order:\n- There is already a generated config.h (from config/config.h.in) it might be confusing if we have another one\n- The best place to start having a look is os_unix_defs.h - some of the things in there are UNIX specific - while others are not. It does make sense to split this up. There is also vim.h (for some very weird ones).\n- At some point in time os_unix_defs.h should disappear in favour of `os/unix_defs.h`\n- The **default** values for options that are platform specific should probably live in `os/unix_defs.h` and `os/win_defs.h`\n- Defaults for options that are not platform specific should be in some new file or may be in `os/os_defs.h`?\n- The best place to override options at compile time would either be at the end of `os/os_defs.h` or in some new file included at the end of `os/os_defs.h`\n\nThat last point does not work right now! - except in my work branches, where os_unix_defs.h is gone :D, but hopefully I'm making some sense here.\n\nDo we want a separate file just for overriding at compile time e.g. userconfig.h or do we just point to at an existing file and add a comment `EDIT AT THE BOTTOM AT YOUR RISK`?\n",

(possibly `#error` when the generic headers' include guard hasn't been activated).\n\n> Do we want a separate file just for overriding at compile time e.g. userconfig.h or do we just point to at an existing file and add a comment EDIT AT THE BOTTOM AT YOUR RISK?\n\nI like the idea of `userconfig.h` (or `user_config.h` or maybe even another name), as it clearly delineates the editable options.\n",
