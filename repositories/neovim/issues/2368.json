However, if you then run the command `:ls` you will see an `h` next to the terminal buffer, meaning \"loaded, but hidden\". If you then run `:buffer <that number>`, the output of `ls` will still be on screen. \n\nTechnically, with `bufhidden=unload`, you can't quit or edit another file without saving or forcing, so one should not be allowed to close the terminal's last window via `:edit`.\n\nOn the other hand, when instead of switching to a new file via `:edit`, one executes `:quit`, assuming there's more than one open window, `bufhidden=hide` seems to work, but `=unload` removes it from the buffer list. That makes sense because without the buffer, the terminal serves little purpose, though a little inconsistent.\n\nSo in short, the biggest bug I see is that escaping a terminal via `:edit` doesn't respect `bufhidden` when it's set to anything other than `hide`.\n",
