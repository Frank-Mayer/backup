It took me a whie to figure out `underline = false` was what was causing the change.\r\n\r\nChanging it to this made things work again:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nvim.diagnostic.config({\r\n    underline = {\r\n        -- Leaving this on, so that we keep `:h hl-DiagnosticUnnecessary`.\r\n        severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.HINT,\r\n    },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems unintuitive to me that these two diagnostics are linked to the \"underline\" option.\r\n\r\nIn the specification [they are called `DiagnosticTag`s](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#diagnosticTag), perhaps there should be a new `tags` option to control these two highlights?\n\n### Steps to reproduce using \"nvim -u minimal_init.lua\"\n\nn/a\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Neovim version (nvim -v)\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-7f9fc2f\n\n### Language server name/version\n\nlua_ls\n\n### Operating system/version\n\nmacOS 14.1\n\n### Log file\n\n_No response_",
