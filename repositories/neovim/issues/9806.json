    "body": "- `nvim --version`: NVIM v0.3.4\r\n- Vim (version: ) behaves differently? yeah , it does. Version is : VIM - Vi IMproved 8.1 (2018 May 18, compiled Mar  6 2019 21:38:32)\r\n- Operating system/version: Arch Linux (up-to-date)\r\n- Terminal name/version:tried it on latest st, termite and alacritty (it doesn't matter what terminal you are using)\r\n- `$TERM`:st-256color(for st), xterm-termite(for termite) and xterm-256color(for alacritty)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce using  `nvim -u NORC`\r\nIt just behaves the same. No matter if I use config-file or not\r\nI tried `nvim .scripts/` to open the directory specified ☝️\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nIt just goes crazy. Terminal window starts changing it's size like 20 times a second. I know I can't explain it better with words so, have a look at this :  https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/9847. If you want the directory I was trying, it here (named '.scripts') : https://github.com/gaurav712/dotfiles_sway.\r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nWell, you know how it should behave. Show the files. Don't do crap stuff.\r\nThe thing is, I like NEOVIM a lot and don't wanna keep vim installed just for some special task.\r\n",

As a workaround, trying forcing the clipboard provider to use something else, e.g. tmux:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    let g:clipboard = {\r\n          \\   'name': 'myClipboard',\r\n          \\   'copy': {\r\n          \\      '+': 'tmux load-buffer -',\r\n          \\      '*': 'tmux load-buffer -',\r\n          \\    },\r\n          \\   'paste': {\r\n          \\      '+': 'tmux save-buffer -',\r\n          \\      '*': 'tmux save-buffer -',\r\n          \\   },\r\n          \\   'cache_enabled': 1,\r\n          \\ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes that fix the behavior? \r\n\r\nThis seems like a bug in wayland/sway ( `wl-copy` or `wl-paste` provokes a resize?), but maybe we can add some logic that prevents hysteresis.",

The only downside with OSC 52 is that it may or may not be available in all terminals and may or may not be turned on by default. For instance, in kitty, writing to the clipboard is enabled by default but reading is turned off for security reasons, the user has to enable it in kitty.conf.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth adding a \"terminal\" provider to the list of clipboard providers you already have. Note that the version of the OSC 52 protocol that kitty implements is slightly modified (in a way that has no bad side-effect in other terminals) to allow for copying arbitrary lengths of text https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/protocol-extensions.html#pasting-to-clipboard",
