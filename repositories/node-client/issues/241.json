It looks like babel is only used here: https://github.com/neovim/node-client/blob/56fefb9195cfe4e3e7a5c9a5d073eb18c4074992/packages/example-plugin-decorators/package.json#L8\r\n\r\nbabel is targeting node 8: https://github.com/neovim/node-client/blob/56fefb9195cfe4e3e7a5c9a5d073eb18c4074992/.babelrc.js#L3\r\nso I had expected it to translate [packages/neovim/](https://github.com/neovim/node-client/tree/master/packages/neovim) to node8-compatible syntax, but seems like that isn't happening.\r\n\r\nSo if we want the \"neovim\" package to be compatible with an old target such as `es2015`, we currently can't rely on babel to polyfill `es2022` libraries/features--rather we must avoid using es2022 libraries in our typescript code.\r\n\r\nIs this a correct understanding?
