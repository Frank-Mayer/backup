I run into channel related issues whenever I use any type `console.log()`.\r\n\r\nIf `console.log()` gets ran in my code, it will work the first time, then the second time it will throw `E475: Invalid argument: Channel doesn't exist`\r\n\r\nAlso logging doesn't work for me. It does create a log file but doesn't write anything into it.\r\n\r\nThe ONLY way that I can log stuffs is to use `console.error()`. Anything else like `console.info`, `console.debug`, etc... will be met with ``E475: Invalid argument: Channel doesn't exist` or `Invalid Channel` error.\r\n\r\nI'm currently using the Devtool to see the console output.",
