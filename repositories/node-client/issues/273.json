    "body": "Hey :)\r\n\r\nWhen we tried to run the provided example in the README (in TypeScript), we encountered three issues:\r\n\r\n- Overwriting \"nvim.window\" gave us a type error. We solved this by just assigning to a local variable.\r\n- Using the provided tests, the check that `lines` should be `[\"\"]` failed for us. It actually was equal to `[]`.\r\n- We got the error \"`nvim_proc.disconnect()` is not a function\". Not sure yet why.\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce these errors?",
