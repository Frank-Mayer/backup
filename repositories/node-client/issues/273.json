We solved this by just assigning to a local variable.\r\n- Using the provided tests, the check that `lines` should be `[\"\"]` failed for us. It actually was equal to `[]`.\r\n- We got the error \"`nvim_proc.disconnect()` is not a function\". Not sure yet why.\r\n\r\nCan you reproduce these errors?",
