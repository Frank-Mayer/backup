So we have to do something like this casting:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst data = await client.executeLua(`return \"hello\"), []) as unknown as string;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is not great.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it works great with arrays as we can use that casting:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  const [val1, val2] = (await client.executeLua(\r\n    luaCode,\r\n    [],\r\n  )) as [number, boolean];\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut when only a single value is returned, we can't cast it without using the ugly \"unknown\" syntax.",
