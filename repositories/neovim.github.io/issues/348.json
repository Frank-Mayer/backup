I have a few ideas on how we could tackle this:\r\n\r\n- Allow users to choose the version for the documentation. I think a good example of this is [cmake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html) (crazy, right?), where the documentation version is prominently shown at the top in an easy place.\r\n\r\n- Use the latest stable in the documentation instead of nightly. This is probably easier to implement. A problem might be that nightly users might start complaining they can't find docs for nightly features.\r\n\r\nOpen to other suggestions.",

But the HEAD docs should stay at the current paths, because:\n\n- avoids breaking URLs\n- avoids needing to update our [Algolia config](https://github.com/neovim/neovim.github.io/issues/310)\n\nThe version-specific docs could live at e.g. `https://neovim.io/doc/user/v0.10/`.\n\nEdit: instead of the above, let's start by using `@since` annotations as much as possible, and use CSS to make those prominent, and maybe show hover info with details.",
