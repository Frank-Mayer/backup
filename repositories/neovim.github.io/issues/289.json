Ex:\r\n      ```\r\n        vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd(\"LspAttach\", {\r\n          group = yourGroupID,\r\n          callback = function(args)\r\n            local client = vim.lsp.get_client_by_id(args.data.client_id)\r\n            your_callbac_func(client, args.buf)\r\n          end\r\n        }\r\n      ```\r\n  - user-defined incremental command preview. \"When you create a command, it is now possible to add a callback function that gets called on every keystroke. Inside of this function you can change the buffer text or add highlights to show the effects your command will have on a buffer. This allows plugin authors to let users preview the effects of their commands before actually executing it. The buffer will be restored to its original state afterwards.\"\r\n- https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config/issues/53",
