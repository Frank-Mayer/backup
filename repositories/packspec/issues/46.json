    "body": "Hi! This \"federated package specification\" looks promising.\r\n\r\nI noticed one thing: why are the engines also not an URL? It does not seem consistent with other aspects of the spec that are deemed important:\r\n\r\n1. Package names are purely _cosmetic_\r\n2. It's a packspec of \"artifacts depending on artifacts\", and those artifacts all 'live' at an URL\r\n3. Consistency with the `dependencies` field\r\n\r\nIt however does seem consistent with [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#engines), where the engines are also just names instead of URLs\r\n\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n  \"name\" : \"lspconfig\", // OPTIONAL cosmetic name, not used for resolution nor filesystem locations.\r\n  \"description\" : \"Quickstart configurations for the Nvim-lsp client\", // OPTIONAL\r\n  \"engines\": {\r\n      \"https://github.com/neovim/neovim\": \"^0.10.0\",\r\n      \"https://github.com/vim/vim\": \"^9.1.0\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"repository\": { // REQUIRED\r\n      \"type\": \"git\", // reserved for future use\r\n      \"url\": \"https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"dependencies\" : { // OPTIONAL\r\n    \"https://github.com/neovim/neovim\" : \"0.6.1\",\r\n    \"https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim\" : \"0.3\"\r\n  },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry if this is out of the question or does not make sense.",

If the client supports the \"nvim\" engine then it knows how to install packages for nvim. \r\n\r\nClients must opt-in to supporting a presumably limited set of engines.
