As this is **the** editor for which we are making the spec.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nI would suggest to introduce a top level table named `engines` or _something_ which can hold the first party version constraints like `neovim` itself.\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nengines = {\r\n    neovim = \">=0.7.0\",\r\n    rpc = \"0.7.0\",\r\n    -- lua = \"LuaJIT\",\r\n    -- treesitter = \"0.9.0\",\r\n    -- vim = \">8.2\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n> What's this `engines` table can hold?\r\n\r\nI am only considering first party components like `neovim` itself but other things can be added if the need arises.\r\n\r\n> Why name it `engines`?\r\n\r\nThis name is coming from `package.json` spec but it can be changed to better complement the neovim community.\r\n\r\n### Prior\r\n\r\n- package.json spec - https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json#engines\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis could also effect https://github.com/nvim-lua/nvim-package-specification/issues/19",
