Defining a dependency tree, in a distributed/federated mannger (no central package registry), using only URLs and versions.\r\n    - Enables [plugin managers](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to install plugin dependencies without explicit instruction by the end-user.\r\n    - Enables package \"aggregators\" ([example](https://neovimcraft.com/)) to partially discover plugins by walking the dependency tree, which reduces maintenance and increases quality of the list.\r\n3. (TBD) Defining ecosystem-defined hooks for pre-install, post-install etc.\r\n\r\nAnything else? Is this problem worth solving? Does #41 solve it?\r\n\r\n\r\n## Elevator pitch\r\n\r\npackspec (or whatever \"wild west half-baked dependencies declaration format\") is merely a high-leverage, ultra-low-effort way to start formally connecting the _existing web_ of vim/nvim dependencies. It doesn't preclude a LuaRocks or other centralized solution later, it simply formalizes what already exists.\r\n\r\n",

Working name is \"Silo\" for dumb artifacts; \"medo\"/meadow for git-versioned trees.  It's a \"meta\" package manager because it invokes containerized apt, pip, etc.\r\n>\r\n> ... No format yet, right now it's shell scripts making the on-disk format, dealing with root/non-root issues.  It's focused on data too big for git as well.  \r\n>\r\n> ... say you want to build something like a VSCode remote server image for neovim, and add say a whole Pandas stack - more coarse-grained composition.  It can invoke any packager manager including a neovim one, but also pip etc.\r\n\r\nThis oilshell effort sounds more like a \"package manager-manager\" (like how cmake is a \"build script generator\").",
