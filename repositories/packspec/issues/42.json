Defining a dependency tree, in a distributed/federated mannger (no central package registry), using only URLs and versions.\r\n    - Enables [plugin managers](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) to install plugin dependencies without explicit instruction by the end-user.\r\n    - Enables package \"aggregators\" ([example](https://neovimcraft.com/)) to partially discover plugins by walking the dependency tree, which reduces maintenance and increases quality of the list.\r\n3. (TBD) Defining ecosystem-defined hooks for pre-install, post-install etc.\r\n\r\nAnything else? Is this problem worth solving? Does #41 solve it?",
