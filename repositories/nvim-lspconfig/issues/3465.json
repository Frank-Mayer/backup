Which means there are two copies of every completion result, code action etc.\n\nThe same occurs with the `eslint` language server. Other language servers do not seem to be affected.\n\nThis only seems to occur when `filetype=typescript`, for example it did not occur when `filetype` was `vue`.\n\nI disabled all language servers but `ts_ls` and still get two copies.\n\nThis happens in the latest neovim nightly build as well as the `v0.10.2` release.\n\nRemoving the single call to `require('lspconfig').ts_ls.setup {}` from my config leads to no `ts_ls` instances being attached (so there are no `ts_ls` instances coming from elsewhere). Re-adding it gives back the two instances, but adding `print` messages show there's definitely only a single call to this function.\n",
