Instead, you'll have to adjust the rate of neovim asking for diagnostics. I found two settings for the lsp setup function: `allow_incremental_sync` and `debounce_text_changes`\r\n\r\nCheck out `:h lsp-client`and look at the `flags` params. For eslint in particular, turning off incremental sync and setting debounce to 1s worked well for me.\r\n\r\nAn alternative I didn't try was to change the capabilities in the setup to disable pull diagnostics for eslint, that way the `run` setting is used.

After a lot of debugging I found that debouncing `tailwindcss` as well fixed my issue:\n```tsx\nrequire(\"lspconfig\").eslint.setup({\n  flags = {\n    allow_incremental_sync = false,\n    debounce_text_changes = 1000,\n  },\n})\nrequire(\"lspconfig\").tailwindcss.setup({\n  flags = {\n    debounce_text_changes = 1000,\n  },\n})\n```\nNot sure why it's relevant.
