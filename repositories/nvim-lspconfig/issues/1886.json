In that case, Solargraph should be executed as `bundle exec solargraph stdio`, and not as `solargraph stdio` so that Solargraph can additionally report formatting issues using the applications' own configuration (e.g. Rubocop).\r\n\r\nThis could be implemented as a fallback: If Solargraph is in the Gemfile, then use it, otherwise fall back to the globally installed Solargraph.\n\n### Other clients which have this feature\n\n_No response_",
