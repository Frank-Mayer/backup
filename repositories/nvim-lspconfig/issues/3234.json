In particular, if I inspect using `:Mason`, 'Lua.completion.callSnippet' is still the default `\"Disable\"`, rather than `\"Replace\"` as specified.\r\n\r\nSee my minimal config [here](https://github.com/mrseanman/kickstart.nvim/blob/minimal_example/init.lua). This is a stripped back version of [kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), where the issue is also present.\r\nI have also tried to pass arguments to `ltex`, with the same issue. I am using `lua_ls` here as an example where I can be sure I haven't made some stupid mistake. I have not tested any other LSPs, the issue may or may not be present for them.\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on most recent nightly and stable nvim. I have tried a clean nvim install and clean install of all plugins with no change.\r\n\r\nI would really appreciate some guidance on what might be going wrong, I am not experienced, but am fairly confident the people who wrote kickstart are! And that this ought to work.\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nNeovim verison:\r\nNVIM v0.11.0-dev-411+geab535e10                                                                    \r\nBuild type: RelWithDebInfo                                                                         \r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1720049189    \r\n\r\nOS: \r\nDebian 12",
