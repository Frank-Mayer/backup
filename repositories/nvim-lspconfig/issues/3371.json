To open them, I always precise the path of the remote file in the CLI as :  `nvim scp://remoteserv/file.txt`\n\nBut when I do this, my LSP doesn't load and I think this is because it cannot find the root directory (or getting to single file mode). That is the output of my LspInfo :\n```\nlspconfig: require(\"lspconfig.health\").check()\n\nLSP configs active in this session (globally)\n- Configured servers: pylsp\n- OK Deprecated servers: (none)\n\nLSP configs active in this buffer (id=1)\n- Language client log: ~/.local/state/nvim/lsp.log\n- Detected filetype: python\n- 0 client(s) attached to this buffer\n- Other clients that match the \"python\" filetype:\n- Config: pylsp\n  filetypes:         python\n  root directory:    ~/Not found.\n  cmd:               ~/.local/bin/pylsp\n  cmd is executable: true\n  autostart:         true\n  custom handlers:\n```\n\nIs there a way to fix that ?",
