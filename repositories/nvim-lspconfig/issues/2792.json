Some of the original maintainers forked the project as [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome).\r\n\r\nThis news is fairly recent, so most likely everyone is still using Rome until everything is sorted out. I'm primarily opening this so the maintainers here can decide what to do. You can likely just copy your Rome configs and replace `rome` with `biome`.\r\n\r\nBiome's official site posted a [quick migration guide](https://biomejs.dev/blog/annoucing-biome) which should be helpful as well.\n\n### Other clients which have this feature\n\n_No response_",
