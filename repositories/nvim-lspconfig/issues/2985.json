Then it gradually goes over 8GiB and eventually gets killed by systemd-oomd. It also constantly uses more than 8% of my CPU.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I use vscode memory usage stays around 2GiB.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is a problem with the lspconfig's default configuration of rust_analyzer?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the right place to report it though\n\n### Neovim version\n\nNVIM v0.9.4\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1702233742\n\n### Nvim-lspconfig version\n\n8917d2c830e04bf944a699b8c41f097621283828\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nArch Linux\n\n### Affected language servers\n\nrust_analyzer\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open a large project in neovim\r\n2. Open the same project in vscode\r\n3. Compare memory usage\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nOOM\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nNo OOM\n\n### Minimal config\n\n```Lua\nlocal lspconfig = require('lspconfig')\r\nlspconfig.rust_analyzer.setup {}\n```\n\n\n### LSP log\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/teackot/af1d753fcb9136809b29bd18d3729c29",
