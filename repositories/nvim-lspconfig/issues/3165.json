I took a look at the [corresponding code](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/9bda20fb967075355f253911bc066a8b5a03c77e/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/lua_ls.lua#L17-L27) and was surprised that finding the git ancestor has lower priority than the `lua/` subdirectories (which, btw, is not mentioned in the [documentation](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#lua_ls)).\r\n\r\nMy specific problem with this: Consider the following directory structure:\r\n```\r\nHOME/\r\n├─ workspaces/\r\n│  ├─ lua/\r\n│  ├─ python/\r\n│  ├─ work/\r\n│  │  ├─ SomeProjectWithLuaFiles/\r\n│  │  │  ├─ .git/\r\n```\r\nThe `lua/` and `python/` directories contain some miscellaneous language-specific projects I sometimes work on. The project directory under Work also contains some lua files. I expected the `.git` directory in the project to ensure that the project root dir is correctly detected to be `…/SomeProjectWithLuaFiles`. But since the [search for the `lua/` subdirectory](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/9bda20fb967075355f253911bc066a8b5a03c77e/lua/lspconfig/server_configurations/lua_ls.lua#L22) is done first, my LSP detects `HOME/workspaces/` as the root directory.\r\n\r\nI know I can easily change this, I was just wondering if this is intended? While I know that many lua projects have a `lua/` subdirectory, I feel that such language-specific workspace directories are not that uncommon, and that the search for the git ancestor should be done before looking for the `lua/` subdirectory.\r\n\r\nEven if it is intended, I think this should be at least mentioned in the documentation for the default `lua_ls` configuration.",
