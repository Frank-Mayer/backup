            "body": "Hey @hrsh7th !\n\nWhat if we create a new repository to store those? Something like `lsp-language-config.nvim` perhaps. It looks like in the case of vscode, a language extension packages config, syntax, snippets, etc. all together. In the neovim ecosystem, all of those aspects are, for better or worse, split up into different plugins.\n\nHaving this separate new package would be useful for many plugins without the need to necessarily depend on lspconfig server setup related functionality. E.g. autoclose plugins, commenting, folding, etc.\n\nSuch a package could be fairly straightforward, maybe just \"forking\" the configs from vscode.\n\nI could help with it if we think it could actually be useful.",
