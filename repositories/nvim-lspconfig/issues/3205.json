One client is called \"rust-analyzer\" and the other one \"rust_analyzer\" (see picture below). This is pretty annoying, as they end up eating twice the RAM needed (which is already fairly high for one instance). \r\n\r\nI tried killing one of the processes : no matter which one I kill, the other works just fine and I still have my diagnostics, but the dead comes back when I open a new script. I do not have any additional configuration for lspconfig. I have a rustacean config, but deleting it does not change anything.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for helping me out !\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/assets/128738169/417975f4-bd5d-48e3-8144-87fe50b50df3)\r\n",
