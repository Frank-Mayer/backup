If this is something that's not going to be implemented, is it something I could do with an autocommand myself? I tried using `CursorHold` together with `vim.lsp.diagnostic.show_line_diagnostics()`, and got the message printed in the command line. However, I would like the message to be removed when I move my cursor again. Thought about `CursorMoved`, but I don't want it to clear every time I move my cursor",
