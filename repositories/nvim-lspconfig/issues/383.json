Coc for example allows to create a `vim/coc-settings.json` similar to vscode's `vscode/settings.json`, which overwrites the global lsp configuration. \r\n\r\nI am using [localvimrc](https://github.com/embear/vim-localvimrc) to load a directory specific vim files automatically.\r\nBut I'm stuck on that point. \r\n\r\nMy latest approach looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nlua << EOF\r\nrequire('nvim_lsp').rust_analyzer.setup {\r\n    on_init = client.workspace_did_change_configuration({\r\n        settings = {\r\n            [\"rust-analyzer\"] = {\r\n                [\"checkOnSave\"] = {\r\n                    [\"enabled\"] = true,\r\n                    [\"command\"] = \"clippy\",\r\n                },\r\n                [\"cargo\"] = {\r\n                    [\"target\"] = \"thumbv7em-none-eabihf\",\r\n                },\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n}\r\nEOF\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is obviously not working.\r\n\r\nI tried the ` client.workspace_did_change_configuration({setup})` approach. But I don't really understand, how to apply it. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blame/6ebd50abb40e8849ae0717328f478ee75cb62568/README.md#L169\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`lua print(vim.inspect(vim.lsp.buf_get_clients()))` show the configuration from above under `config.settings`\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nLocal settings are not getting applied. \r\n\r\n```\r\nlocalvimrc: error when sourcing script: \"Vim(lua):E5108: Error executing lua [string \":lua\"]:2: attempt to index global 'client' (a nil value)\" (<...>/.lvimrc, line 20)\r\n```",

            "body": "> If `require('lspconfig').foo.setup` is put in both the global and local configs, won't the language server be started twice? Or is the suggestion to only call `setup` in local configs?\r\n\r\nI was also wondering about this. From what I understand, the LS is only launched once, but the second call to setup() replaces its settings?\r\n\r\nBut I think with the wiki section suggesting `.exrc`/`.nvim.lua` it would be good to clarify the interaction. From a brief test it seems to work alright for simple use cases.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that the second setup() call overrides the settings, which are only used once the Lsp actually starts/attaches to a buffer. So it's fine to call setup() more than once at startup, but it wouldn't work while neovim is already running.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I've ended up reading the [setup() function ](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/d1d8b8a0180aafb5cf8f0454b52adb6d1e9522cb/lua/lspconfig/configs.lua#L66-L272) and as far as I can tell, it does just replace settings. However, it can register duplicate autocmds if `autostart` is set to true. Unsure how big of a problem that is.",
