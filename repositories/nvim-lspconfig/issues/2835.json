    "body": "### Description\n\nPlease have a look at https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/25375 for backstory. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, neovim's lsp client is `pcall`ing user config callbacks and discarding their return. Configs recommended by `nvim-lspconfig` using `on_init` assume `client.workspace_folders` is defined, but `nvim-lspconfig` removes it in single file mode. The callback throws an error attempting to index `nil`, neovim swallows it, and there is no indication whatsoever that the user's initialization failed. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/68b23c06132cb1ef8d5690111c112388fbcf1c30/lua/lspconfig/manager.lua#L145-L152\r\n\r\nRelevant config recommendations include:\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#lua_ls\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/wiki/Project-local-settings\r\nand these have been [propagated elsewhere](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22local+path+%3D+client.workspace_folders%5B1%5D.name%22&rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS939US939&oq=%22local+path+%3D+client.workspace_folders%5B1%5D.name%22&aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160l5j33i299l2.703j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). \r\n\r\nI would also like to point out that `nvim-lspconfig` is also using `pcall` to haphazardly silence errors. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/68b23c06132cb1ef8d5690111c112388fbcf1c30/lua/lspconfig/configs.lua#L94-L96\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/68b23c06132cb1ef8d5690111c112388fbcf1c30/lua/lspconfig/configs.lua#L197-L202\r\n\n\n### Neovim version\n\nNVIM v0.10.0-dev-1203+g0592fd5e1\r\nBuild type: Release\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.1695409640\r\n\n\n### Nvim-lspconfig version\n\n68b23c06132cb1ef8d5690111c112388fbcf1c30\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nn/a\n\n### Affected language servers\n\nlua_ls\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Build `neovim`\r\n2. Install prebuilt `lua-language-server` \r\n3. Install `nvim-lspconfg`\r\n4. Config `lua-ls` using https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#lua_ls\r\n5. Open lua file without a workspace. \n\n### Actual behavior\n\nThe lsp client is starts successfully but config during `on_init` does not complete and no indication is given that there was a problem. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\nRecommended `lua_ls` config should work without problems regardless of single file mode. Errors that can't be handled gracefully should never be thrown away.\n\n### Minimal config\n\n```Lua\nrequire'lspconfig'.lua_ls.setup {\r\n  on_init = function(client)\r\n    local path = client.workspace_folders[1].name\r\n    if not vim.loop.fs_stat(path..'/.luarc.json') and not vim.loop.fs_stat(path..'/.luarc.jsonc') then\r\n      client.config.settings = vim.tbl_deep_extend('force', client.config.settings, {\r\n        Lua = {\r\n          runtime = {\r\n            -- Tell the language server which version of Lua you're using\r\n            -- (most likely LuaJIT in the case of Neovim)\r\n            version = 'LuaJIT'\r\n          },\r\n          -- Make the server aware of Neovim runtime files\r\n          workspace = {\r\n            checkThirdParty = false,\r\n            library = {\r\n              vim.env.VIMRUNTIME\r\n              -- \"${3rd}/luv/library\"\r\n              -- \"${3rd}/busted/library\",\r\n            }\r\n            -- or pull in all of 'runtimepath'. NOTE: this is a lot slower\r\n            -- library = vim.api.nvim_get_runtime_file(\"\", true)\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n\r\n      client.notify(\"workspace/didChangeConfiguration\", { settings = client.config.settings })\r\n    end\r\n    return true\r\n  end\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### LSP log\n\n-",
