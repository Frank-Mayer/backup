After updating Lazy/Mason yesterday, pyright suddenly failed to identify import modules for some repos. `pyright --verbose` seems perfect, all of the search paths are correct, $PATH and PYTHONPATH seem perfect within neovim.\r\n\r\nThis seems to correlate with `basedpyright` propagating through the toolchain, but I haven't even installed it, let alone activate it. \r\n\r\nI've decided it must be down to one weird line in my LspLog:\r\n`[INFO][2024-03-21 11:40:15] ...lsp/handlers.lua:584\t'Setting pythonPath for service \"/Users/<user>/Development/EDGE/edge-streaming-backend-service\": \"/Users/<user>/.pyenv/versions/edge-financial-3.6.8/bin/python\"'`\r\n\r\nI haven't used pyenv in years, I have no clue how this association is being made. Pyenv is nowhere on my $PATH. Theres no shell hooks. *I don't even have a ~/.pyenv folder!*\r\n\r\n Pyright and python say absolutely nothing about pyenv otherwise. `checkhealth` also gives me my correct `venv` environment, no pyenv.\r\n\r\n1) Does anyone know how this association is being made?\r\n2) Why is this ONLY visible buried deep in the logs?",

I guess the LSP automatically reads from that, maybe a consequence of Pyright being a vscode LSP primarily? Or is that a Neovim behavior?\r\n\r\nIt still feels like LspInfo / checkhealth should be reporting this somehow, the pythonpath was being silently overridden. Is that strange behavior, or am I mistaken? If it is wrong, who should I report this to?",
