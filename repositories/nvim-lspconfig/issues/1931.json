Or better, by adding a failing test case to [lsp_spec.lua](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/functional/plugin/lsp_spec.lua), which has code to setup a fake LSP server to simulate various scenarios.",

I only use lazy.nvim, not LazyVim, so I just have `lua/plugins/notify.lua` with the following:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nreturn {\r\n  \"rcarriga/nvim-notify\",\r\n  config = function()\r\n    -- See https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/issues/1931#issuecomment-1297599534\r\n    -- An alternative solution: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/20457#issuecomment-1266782345\r\n    local banned_messages = { \"No information available\" }\r\n    vim.notify = function(msg, ...)\r\n      for _, banned in ipairs(banned_messages) do\r\n        if msg == banned then\r\n          return\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n      return require(\"notify\")(msg, ...)\r\n    end\r\n  end,\r\n}\r\n\r\n```",
