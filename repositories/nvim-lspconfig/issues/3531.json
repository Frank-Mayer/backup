See the following code which causes existing language servers with the same name to be reused.\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/57154fd9a24e76907e3b0bdba4677ef42c88d91c/lua/lspconfig/manager.lua#L133-L136\n\nEither the code should be updated to match the docs, or the docs should be corrected and a new flag should be added to indicate that unique root dirs should always launch new language server instances. I am happy to try out a PR if the maintainers have a preference for either of those solutions.",
