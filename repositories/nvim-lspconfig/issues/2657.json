If that is the case, I suppose we have to open a feature request to Neovim to allow named pipe communication? Looking at the code this did not look like an option at the moment.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the Roslyn Language Server to attach, I also had to make a \"solution/open\" notification request to the Language Server in order for things like \"Go To Definition\" to work. \"solution/open\" does not appear to be part of the LSP spec. Maybe we could make a custom handler for the \"initialize\" request response that would fire back a \"solution/open\" request?\r\n\r\nI am currently working on the Diagnostics. In order to get them running at all, I had to use the development release of Neovim. It has support for the textDocument/diagnostic request. It seems to fire it off after it makes textDocument/didChange requests. The diagnostics request seems to work fine given it has the correct text of a \".cs\" file. However, that was not always the case. The Language Server's copy of the \".cs\" file gets corrupted. This appears to be happening in trying to keep the \".cs\" file up to date with the textDocument/didChange requests. I'm trying to figure out if the requests are not being issued properly by Neovim or if they are not being handled properly by the server. ",

            "body": "Hi @boost1231\r\n\r\n> Were there any reasons you chose to add a command to install the Language Server as oppose to using a package manager like Mason.nvim?\r\n\r\nNot at all, from the beginning my purpose was to integrate the installation process into Mason.nvim, but first I wanted to make sure the install process worked correctly, otherwise trying to reverse engineer the vscode extension for how the install should be done at the same time I implemented it in Mason would have been too complicated. **This is the next thing I'm planning to focus on**.\r\n\r\n> There are multiple issues in the current Roslyn LSP, it doesn't follow the LSP spec in some scenarios.\" Can you expand on what isn't following the spec? It looks like they fixed the issue with TextDocument/didChange notifications.\r\n\r\nif you go to the [hacks file](https://github.com/jmederosalvarado/roslyn.nvim/blob/main/lua/roslyn/hacks.lua) in the plugin, you will see there are multiple scenario that need some kind of workaround for neovim to work well with roslyn. Not all of them are problems with roslyn, some are neovim lsp client issues, and for others I'm yet to figure out which one is not following the spec. I'll list them bellow and link to the issue in the corresponding repo:\r\n\r\n1. `textDocument/didChange` issue: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70392\r\n2. Neovim emitting warning on unknown diagnostic tag: this is a neovim issue, as unknown diagnostic tags should be ignored. PR to fix this: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/25705\r\n3. On [`didChangeWatchedFiles` registration](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#didChangeWatchedFilesRegistrationOptions) roslyn is asking neovim to watch a `baseDir` that doesn't exist and neovim file watcher crashes. I'm yet to figure out if roslyn shouldn't be asking to watch missing directories or if neovim should ignore this watcher when the `baseDir` doesn't exist.\r\n4. Also on `didChangeWatchedFiles` roslyn is sending the `baseDir` to watch with a trailing `/`, but neovim is assuming no trailing slash exist and it's [adding one to the pattern](https://github.com/jmederosalvarado/neovim/blob/831d662ac6756cab4fed6a9b394e68933b5fe325/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/_watchfiles.lua#L166) which results in pattern trying to match paths with `//` (two consecutive slashes). This one will probably be on the neovim side to just sanitize the uri received from the server.\r\n\r\nSo, (3) and (4) are fairly low priority for now, as you could just disable file watching. Neovim nightly [introduces support](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/16078) for [didChangeWatchedFiles](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles). Neovim uses system file watchers to let the server know whenever a file changes. You can disable this capability by doing:\r\n```lua\r\ncapabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend(\"force\", capabilities, {\r\n    workspace = {\r\n        didChangeWatchedFiles = {\r\n            dynamicRegistration = false,\r\n        },\r\n    },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy intention is to slim down the plugin as much as possible, by porting install functionality to mason, and fixing in neovim the rest of the issues, but it will take some time to get there.",

            "body": "I find that when I make code changes to FileA that breaks code in a FileB that is loaded in another hidden buffer, diagnostics are not reported when I switch to FileB. \r\n\r\nThe LSP spec has a \"relatedDocuments\" property that appears like it would support this very scenario. (https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/lsp/3.17/specification/#relatedFullDocumentDiagnosticReport). However, as far as I can tell, Roslyn does not populate that property even though the serverCapabilities it reports would indicate otherwise. In any case, I opened an issue: https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/70616 (edit: this was already closed, may have misinterpreted the use for the property)\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I added this to the on_attach callback:\r\n```\r\nif client.supports_method(require('vim.lsp.protocol').Methods.textDocument_diagnostic) then\r\n\r\n    vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd('BufEnter', {\r\n      buffer = bufnr,\r\n      callback = function()\r\n            require('vim.lsp.util')._refresh(\r\n                require('vim.lsp.protocol').Methods.textDocument_diagnostic,\r\n                { only_visible = true, client_id = client.id })\r\n      end,\r\n    })\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\nSo that diagnostics are pulled every time I enter a buffer. It works in the simple case I tested it in.\r\n\r\nHas anyone else experienced this issue? Or have any other suggestions on how to deal with it? I wonder if neovim should allow configuration around when diagnostics are pulled. It seems like how often and when could be a matter of preference. Here is a code link in the neovim repo that shows when diagnostics are pulled: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/diagnostic.lua#L425",

Copying is needed because we need to use some functions/classes that are private.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to debug another issue today regarding performance, I found out that the code to getting roslyn to work in neovim can be simplified _a lot_, and that it isn't actually necessary to duplicate the whole rpc module: https://github.com/seblj/roslyn.nvim/commit/8f097106b61d51fe13d8c424a347f305c48ffefd\r\n\r\nTLDR; You can just start the language server, and in the stdout handler, parse the name of the pipe and use it as a parameter for `vim.lsp.rpc.connect`. Then you can just schedule `vim.lsp.start`, and use `vim.lsp.rpc.connect(pipe_name)` as `cmd`, and everything should work\r\n\r\nI am still having a couple of issues with the language server though, and on some repos I have, it will come to a serious halt. Neovim will be really slow to quit, and in some cases, I also get a lot of errors... I haven't really figured out these issues, and it also doesn't seem like vscode has the same issue. I don't know if anyone else have been looking into this, but I thought I should share my findings in removing the entire duplication of the rpc module😄 \r\n\r\nEDIT: I found out about why it just completely froze neovim sometimes. It has to do with `watchfunc` in neovim, and `didChangeWatchedFiles`. There is already an open issue about this in neovim from April 2023, so it may be worth it to turn it off if you notice any issues with this",
