If that is the case, I suppose we have to open a feature request to Neovim to allow named pipe communication? Looking at the code this did not look like an option at the moment.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the Roslyn Language Server to attach, I also had to make a \"solution/open\" notification request to the Language Server in order for things like \"Go To Definition\" to work. \"solution/open\" does not appear to be part of the LSP spec. Maybe we could make a custom handler for the \"initialize\" request response that would fire back a \"solution/open\" request?\r\n\r\nI am currently working on the Diagnostics. In order to get them running at all, I had to use the development release of Neovim. It has support for the textDocument/diagnostic request. It seems to fire it off after it makes textDocument/didChange requests. The diagnostics request seems to work fine given it has the correct text of a \".cs\" file. However, that was not always the case. The Language Server's copy of the \".cs\" file gets corrupted. This appears to be happening in trying to keep the \".cs\" file up to date with the textDocument/didChange requests. I'm trying to figure out if the requests are not being issued properly by Neovim or if they are not being handled properly by the server. ",
