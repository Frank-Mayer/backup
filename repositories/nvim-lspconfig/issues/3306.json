However, it is also therefore that I ask that this deprecation be _documented_ so that such a user can find that information! Good documenation and careful engineering is necessary for good software. \r\n\r\nI would highly implore you to take backwards compatibility seriously and not break people's setups without proper documentation, even if they happen to use what you call \"third party\" plugins.

Feel free to reword it or move however you see fit. I also suggest your project have a deprecation / change history somewhere for people to look at, which I haven't included in this PR.
