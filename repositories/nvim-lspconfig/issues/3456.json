Checking the health of the plugin showed two instances of both ruff and pyright running in the initial buffer that was entered after restoring the session. Keyboard shortcuts for prev-symbol (`[[`) didn't work anymore and the shortcut for the next-symbol (`]]`) jumped to weird positions, like from a symbol (class name) jumped to the next class keyword.\n\nAt some point after changing buffers and restarting nvim a couple of times I noticed I had 3-4 copies of each language server running and keyboard shortcuts became even more broken. The keyboard shortcut for the previous-symbol deleted a range of text and replaced it with some random pasted content.\n\nThis only seems to apply to the first buffer entered after starting nvim and restoring the session. The other buffers I switch to only seem to have a single copy of the language server running for them and they don't exhibit keyboard shortcut problems.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0da6e667-1dc1-445b-a938-a0591cad6682)\n\nI reverted fe88eade4ab50fca9ace99205cad1d91645ed9e8 and things went back to normal.",
