I'm not specifing the servers directly, but rather fetching the installed ones from mason and then iterating over them after. Hence the slightly alien syntax, but I guess you will figure that out for you. I will then attach for all installed servers like so:\r\n```lua\r\nmason_lspconfig.setup_handlers {\r\n    function(server_name)\r\n        require('lspconfig')[server_name].setup {\r\n            capabilities = capabilities,\r\n            on_attach = require('config.keymaps').lsp_keymaps,\r\n            settings = installed_servers[server_name],\r\n            filetypes = (installed_servers[server_name] or {}).filetypes,\r\n            bundle_path = (installed_servers[server_name] or {}).bundle_path,\r\n            handlers = handlers,\r\n         }\r\n    end,\r\n}\r\n```",

Very strange. I even tried turning off all the Windows Defender features in the VM with no difference in behaviour.\r\n\r\nJust to be sure Mason was installing PSES correctly, I tried replacing the package with the latest release from the [repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/releases/tag/v3.13.0). No difference. The client starts but doesn't attach to the buffer. ",

To make Neovim not load it you only need to do the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n      require(\"lspconfig\").powershell_es.setup {\r\n        bundle_path = \"path/to/your/bundle_path\",\r\n        init_options = {\r\n          enableProfileLoading = false,\r\n        },\r\n      }\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be worth adding this to the default powershell_es config? Or some mention to it in on its documentation?",
