    "body": "### Description\n\nSomehow the version check in `:checkhealth` is causing Neovim to hang for a minute or so before producing output when trying to get the version for tailwindcss LSP. The whole program locks up and won't allow any user input until the version check returns. This could also be happening for other language servers, but I've only noticed this one so far. I tried reducing the timeout in `try_get_cmd_output` and it looks like it's working normally with the value set to 100 or so. No idea why the value of 1000 is causing the hang.",
