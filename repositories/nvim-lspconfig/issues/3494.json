Previously, the config format was defined by nvim-lspconfig (this repo) and did not have core Nvim support.\n\n# Next steps\n\n\n1. Tag a `v1.x` release.\n4. ~~BREAKING: The `master` branch will require Nvim 0.11 and will throw an error if `vim.lsp.config` is not found (and point the user to the v1.x branch).~~\n5. keep the old configs on master, but document that they are frozen and won't be supported.\n6. if Nvim 0.10 or older is detected, use the old frozen configs\n7. Update the README to mention that old configs are frozen, use Nvim 0.11\n8. Migrate all configs in nvim-lspconfig to `vim.lsp.config`\n    - put all the new configs on `lsp/*` and use those for Nvim 0.11",
