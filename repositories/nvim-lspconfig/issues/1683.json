    "body": "### Description\n\nWhile in my project, ALS works just fine, assuming I have a single .gpr file.\r\nBut when I jump through a reference to some library, I get a new ALS instance which fails because it is given the root directory of the library, which contains multiple or zero .gpr files.\n\n### Neovim version\n\nNVIM v0.6.0-dev+560-g1fdbd29df\r\nBuild type: RelWithDebInfo\r\nLuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3\r\nCompilation: /usr/bin/gcc-11 -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1 -DNVIM_TS_HAS_SET_MATCH_LIMIT -O2 -g -Og -g -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Wno-unused-parameter -Wstrict-prototypes -std=gnu99 -Wshadow -Wconversion -Wmissing-prototypes -Wimplicit-fallthrough -Wvla -fstack-protector-strong -fno-common -fdiagnostics-color=always -DINCLUDE_GENERATED_DECLARATIONS -D_GNU_SOURCE -DNVIM_MSGPACK_HAS_FLOAT32 -DNVIM_UNIBI_HAS_VAR_FROM -DMIN_LOG_LEVEL=3 -I/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/build/config -I/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/src -I/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/.deps/usr/include -I/usr/include -I/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/build/src/nvim/auto -I/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/build/include\r\nCompiled by runner@fv-az32-619\r\n\r\nFeatures: +acl +iconv +tui\r\nSee \":help feature-compile\"\r\n\r\n   system vimrc file: \"$VIM/sysinit.vim\"\r\n  fall-back for $VIM: \"\r\n/home/runner/work/neovim/neovim/build/nvim.AppDir/usr/share/nvim\"\r\n\n\n### Nvim-lspconfig version\n\nc510964\n\n### Operating system and version\n\nUbuntu 21.04\n\n### Affected language servers\n\nals\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open Ada file (e.g. src/mkproj.adb in [mkproj](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/mkproj))\r\n2. Go to definition on something in the gnat runtime, e.g. Ada.Environment_Variables on line 8 of above.\n\n### Actual behavior\n\nALS spits out this error: 'LSP[als] More than one .gpr found. Note: you can configure a project through the ada.projectFile setting' and also doesn't work. For example, I can't jump to definitions / references in the library file now.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nExpected behaviour is to not throw an error and for ALS to work inside the library file as well.\r\n\r\nOne way to get that behaviour is to set the root dir to /, as in [PR1678](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/pull/1678). This causes the lspconfig to reuse the ALS instance for the project, which already chose the correct gpr file. To chose a different project, you have to restart neovim, or use [this gpr selector plugin](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/nvim-lsp-gpr-selector).\r\n\r\nBut I assume you have a different fix in mind, since you closed the PR.\n\n### Minimal config\n\n```Lua\nlocal on_windows = vim.loop.os_uname().version:match 'Windows'\r\n\r\nlocal function join_paths(...)\r\n  local path_sep = on_windows and '\\\\' or '/'\r\n  local result = table.concat({ ... }, path_sep)\r\n  return result\r\nend\r\n\r\nvim.cmd [[set runtimepath=$VIMRUNTIME]]\r\n\r\nlocal temp_dir = vim.loop.os_getenv 'TEMP' or '/tmp'\r\n\r\nvim.cmd('set packpath=' .. join_paths(temp_dir, 'nvim', 'site'))\r\n\r\nlocal package_root = join_paths(temp_dir, 'nvim', 'site', 'pack')\r\nlocal install_path = join_paths(package_root, 'packer', 'start', 'packer.nvim')\r\nlocal compile_path = join_paths(install_path, 'plugin', 'packer_compiled.lua')\r\n\r\nlocal function load_plugins()\r\n  require('packer').startup {\r\n    {\r\n      'wbthomason/packer.nvim',\r\n      'neovim/nvim-lspconfig',\r\n    },\r\n    config = {\r\n      package_root = package_root,\r\n      compile_path = compile_path,\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\nend\r\n\r\n_G.load_config = function()\r\n  vim.lsp.set_log_level 'trace'\r\n  if vim.fn.has 'nvim-0.5.1' == 1 then\r\n    require('vim.lsp.log').set_format_func(vim.inspect)\r\n  end\r\n  local nvim_lsp = require 'lspconfig'\r\n  local on_attach = function(_, bufnr)\r\n    local function buf_set_keymap(...)\r\n      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(bufnr, ...)\r\n    end\r\n    local function buf_set_option(...)\r\n      vim.api.nvim_buf_set_option(bufnr, ...)\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    buf_set_option('omnifunc', 'v:lua.vim.lsp.omnifunc')\r\n\r\n    -- Mappings.\r\n    local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', 'gD', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.declaration()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', 'gd', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', 'K', '<Cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', 'gi', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.implementation()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<C-k>', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.signature_help()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>wa', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.add_workspace_folder()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>wr', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.remove_workspace_folder()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>wl', '<cmd>lua print(vim.inspect(vim.lsp.buf.list_workspace_folders()))<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>D', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.type_definition()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>rn', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', 'gr', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.references()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>e', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.diagnostic.show_line_diagnostics()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '[d', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.diagnostic.goto_prev()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', ']d', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.diagnostic.goto_next()<CR>', opts)\r\n    buf_set_keymap('n', '<space>q', '<cmd>lua vim.lsp.diagnostic.set_loclist()<CR>', opts)\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  -- Add the server that troubles you here\r\n  local name = 'als'\r\n  nvim_lsp[name].setup {\r\n    on_attach = on_attach,\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  print [[You can find your log at $HOME/.cache/nvim/lsp.log.

I would rather solve the general case elegantly than bolt something on to lspconfig to address your immediate problem.\r\n\r\nHere are some concrete suggestions:\r\n* Ensure single_file_support is disabled and special case the root pattern in ALS to ignore system libraries to prevent ALS from starting for system libraries.

However, the problem is very clearly in lspconfig, not als, because the problem relates to when to start up als in the first place, and what to pass as the .gpr file to that language server. Hence, there cannot be any solution inside als itself.\r\n\r\nMost language servers don't have the feature available, that you can search for system library usages within a particular project - because they do not have this concept of a project file that is understood by the language server. So instead, most language servers rely on 'single-file mode' which supports far less, even though it does work.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the proper solution is to add a new feature to lspconfig, allowing a server to set a boolean that says 'always re-use the existing languageserver instance'. This would be a feature added to all language-servers, even if als is the first to use it.\r\n\r\nSince a complaint was made about special-casing lspconfig for als, I did it using the hack of setting the workspace to /, to include the whole system, so that it connects the new file to the existing als instance. For windows, I think the empty string would work (because paths there start with a driveletter).",
