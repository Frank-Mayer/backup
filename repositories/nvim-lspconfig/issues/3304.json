Nowhere is it explained that I have go into my config and rename it to \"ts_ls\". For me to figure that out I had to go on a wild chase through your commits! \r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if it was possible for the error message to say as much, or some other way of alerting me to the fact I had to rename the paramter in my config. At least it would help if it was mentioned somewhere in this repo, and not just in the commit messages (which will only get older and harder to find for future people in a similar situation as time passes). This is a very confusing situation right now that makes no sense to a poor end user like myself. ",
