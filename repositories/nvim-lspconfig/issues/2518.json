So I implemented the concept of a workspace in lspconfig. The way it works is. You can create multiple worksapce. A default space is automatically created when the first project is opened. If you don't change the workspace. All open projects will belong to the default space. When you open the project after changing the workspace shown, it will check whether the server supports the workspace_folder feature. Send didchangeworkspacefolder notification if supported. Re-use the server. Otherwise a new server instance will be started. \r\n\r\nfor this issue . now it works like this  \r\n1. open `helloword` project now lspconfig will create a `default` workspace. \r\n2. run `go to definition` it open file which in sysroot. but it still in default workspace . so reuse client and don't send notify \r\n  even the `rust_analyzer` now support `workspaceFodler`. \r\n3. now it don't show any diagnostic\r\n\r\n![Untitled](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/assets/41671631/4856c747-9257-4236-818b-378ca00ac28d)\r\n\r\n",

I've been trying to fix it for over a week at this point with still no clue why it's doing this. I only started using neovim recently and all I used is the default config from kickstart.nvim. Whenever I open a file that is from a dependency and not in the CWD it starts running a cargo check. I've resorted to using `autostart = false` and start it manually. When I use `:LspStart` at the root of a rust project everything works fine and it doesn't try to run cargo check outside of the cwd but if I let autostart do it's thing then it tries to run cargo check in other files that I definitely don't want ti to.",
