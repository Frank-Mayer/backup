This is incompatible with distant as the function typically performs local operations such as reading files, navigating directories, and running processes.\r\n\r\nSee [rust-analyzer.lua](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/28a8e5258cb8140cc50a030b9b3c15e39376028a/lua/lspconfig/rust_analyzer.lua#L18) for calls to `vim.fn.jobstart`, `util.find_git_ancestor`, and `util.root_pattern`. The nvim-lspconfig util functions in turn call [`uv.fs_stat` via exists(...)](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/28a8e5258cb8140cc50a030b9b3c15e39376028a/lua/lspconfig/util.lua#L112) and perform other local operations.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is that distant.nvim could provide a compatibility function that, when executed, will attempt to wrap globals like `vim.fn.jobstart` and `uv.fs_stat` to be executed in a remote context. Even if that existed, we'd need some way to plug into nvim-lspconfig to detect whether a buffer was local or remote - distant.nvim can already do this - and then perform the injection accordingly.\r\n\r\nOf course, if there's another way that nvim-lspconfig could be redesigned to support alternative root_dir lookups without overwriting a bunch of global functions, I'd be more than happy to pursue that direction.\r\n\r\n### Other clients which have this feature\r\n\r\n_No response_",

We need to be able to detect if the buffer represents a local or remote file, and if remote then distant will spawn the language server otherwise we leave it up to the default neovim libuv logic. This is currently done via the distant.nvim plugin using [this logic](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim/blob/83e655a75155271a900faf6e8f86d11023d1bb7e/lua/distant/lsp.lua#L272).\r\n\r\nI could also imagine that it would be desirable to separate out configs for local versus remote servers. A workspace on a remote machine might not be what you want locally. In fact, you might want different workspace locations for different servers.\r\n\r\n```\r\nOn server A.A.A.A:\r\n    Open `rls` remotely for '/path/to/rust/project1' and /path/to/rust/project2' for `*.rs`\r\nOn server B.B.B.B:\r\n    Open `rls` remotely for '/path/to/rust/project1' and /other/project_abc' for `*.rs`\r\nOn local machine:\r\n    Open `rls` locally for any `*.rs` with `Cargo.toml` marking the root directory\r\n```\r\n\r\ndistant.nvim already supports distinct configurations based on the server, but I'm not sure how that would work with lspconfig as it has a singular config that's generic (using your root patterns function).\r\n\r\n### Core neovim requirements\r\n\r\nThe main requirements for distant to work with language servers (described in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/15847) are\r\n\r\n1. Take control of launching and managing the language server (e.g. spawn and kill handler functions)\r\n2. Act as the proxy for pipes (e.g. stdin, stdout, and stderr for LSP servers)\r\n\r\nFor the above, I hack this as seen in [distant.nvim/lsp.lua](https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim/blob/83e655a75155271a900faf6e8f86d11023d1bb7e/lua/distant/lsp.lua).",
