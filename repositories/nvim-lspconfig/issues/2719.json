The issue is, I can't get it to work myself.\r\n\r\nI am editing my `server_configurations` directory directly to ensure there's no gotchas. It seems like the `default_config.cmd` function has to do something like `return vim.lsp.rpc.connect('127.0.0.1', port_num)`.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine when I launch the lsp (`woke --debug lsp --port 65433` for example) and just connect to it. However, I cannot get it work by adding a\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nos.execute('woke lsp --port ' .. port_str .. ' &')\r\n```\r\n\r\nin the aforementioned function (the `&` at the end should presumably launch it as a background process). Are there any examples/guides how to do this? ðŸ™‚ It seems like there is just one tcp server (gdscript.lua) and that connects to an ex-ante-launched process \n\n### Other clients which have this feature\n\n_No response_",

Using os.execute plus shell tricks is fragile and platform-specific. In Nvim 0.10 you can using `vim.spawn`, in older Nvim you can use `jobstart()` to start a background process.\r\n\r\nThe title of this issue requests a \"guide\" for this specific thing, that's out of scope for nvim-lspconfig which is just a collection of configs.",
