I'm not sure what the best way is to decouple it. I've asked in [this thread](https://github.com/crate-ci/typos/issues/263). How was this dealt with for `tsserver`? Do you just use the entire repo and not really care about the VSC\\*\\*de specific stuff?~\r\n\r\n**Edit**: The language server binary is now published under [typos-vscode's releases](https://github.com/tekumara/typos-vscode/releases).\r\n\r\n### Other clients which have this feature\r\n\r\n_No response_",
