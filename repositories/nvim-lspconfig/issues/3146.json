Upon updating, ESLint functionality appears to break. Tested in different OS's and different node versions.\r\n\r\nBefore the update (at version 4.8.0), ESLint was functioning as expected within my projects, providing linting feedback and error/warning highlights in my code.\r\n\r\nAfter updating to 4.9.0 and then 4.10.0, ESLint no longer provides linting feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure if this is the correct place to report this issue, but I wanted to bring it to your attention in case others are experiencing similar problems. Thank you for your help and for maintaining this important tool.\r\n",
