However, upon inquiry at the biome repo, I've been told [that the biome LSP is indeed capable of formatting, if dynamically registered](https://github.com/biomejs/biome/discussions/87).\r\n\r\nI somewhat lack the knowledge about how LSPs work, but it looks to me like it is only specific form of configuration that is missing to enable that?\n\n### Other clients which have this feature\n\n_No response_",
