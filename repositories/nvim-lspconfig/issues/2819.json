Are they expected to copy-paste the entire file to their config just to add 10 chars? If `lspconfig` is just a \"a repo collected as server configuration\", then why not remove `.setup()` altogether and just make everything static and unconfigurable?\r\n\r\nThis overall situation has been really frustrating. Apparently users are expected to use `vim.lsp.start`, which makes this whole thing even more confusing. Is `lspconfig` going to be deprecated? \r\n\r\nBecause the current feature parity between `lspconfig` and `vim.lsp.start` is not even close, and I don't really see any signs that it would change. No client re-use, no status menu, no stop/start/restart interface. \r\n\r\nAnd let's say that we now have feature parity. What will happen to `lspconfig` then? Is every user now expected to write hundreds or even thousands of lines inside their local config just to set up every single LSP client from a scratch?\r\n\r\nI just don't see a clear path forward here.",
