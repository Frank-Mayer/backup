I find that peeking under the hood of a running LSP client helps when debugging LSP issues. For new users especially, as doing this manually requires pulling together a handful of concepts (inspecting a table, printing to new buffer, etc).\r\n\r\n- The output is printed to a new buffer for easy search/yank/diff/etc.\r\n- While the output is not valid lua syntax, it's close enough that calling `set syntax=lua` does make it easier to do a quick eye scan.\r\n- I have no strong opinion on what key to assign this to. I currently have it set to `K`.\r\n- `K` doesn't need to be pressed on a specific column, anywhere on the same line will do.",

I agree that, ideally, we should decide on using only one and appreciate that that is what you're trying to do here. This is anecdotal, but from browsing the /r/neovim subreddit I think most users rely on `:LspInfo` at this time?\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that you don't want to increase the maintenance burden of this repo, I'd argue that this PR reduces it. It invites curious new users to peek into the LSP client config. It is those types of users who then become likely to identify issues and contribute bug fixes and improvements to the configs hosted in this repo, reducing the overall maintenance effort required by any single maintainer.\r\n\r\nIt's also worth mentioning that this has been requested at least once (#2412) before this year, by a plugin author no less (as opposed to a newer user). It could also close #2758?\r\n\r\nThat was only _my_ opinion on the matter. And while I am disappointed, I respect that you might have different views because you see things differently (and you interact with users _a lot_ more than I do).\r\n",
