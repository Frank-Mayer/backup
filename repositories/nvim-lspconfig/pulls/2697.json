            "body": "This is a bad idea. Like I mentioned in #2728 , this PR disables single-file mode entirely. You are forcing the root directory to always fallback to Neovim's current working directory even though some files are meant to be edited with the LSP launched in single-file mode without any root directory set.\r\n\r\n> This behavior is more natural and the default in VS Code\r\n\r\nJust because a behavior is the default for VS Code does not mean it is appropriate for the workflow of Neovim.  Let me give you an example of why this PR is such a bad idea.\r\n\r\nLet's say I'm currently in my home directory when I launch neovim from the terminal. This will essentially set Neovim's cwd to my home directory. After neovim launches, I open a file `script.py` from inside neovim `:e /path/to/script.py`. `script.py` is not a component of some grand software repository. It is a utility script that performs some routine task. As such, it will sit inside a directory without any root markers. And now because of this PR, `script.py` will never open in single-file mode. Since neovim's cwd is my home directory, `nvim-lspconfig` opens `pyright` with the root directory set to my home directory. But what if my home directory is a huge directory with hundreds of files? This causes significant deterioration in terms of LSP performance. Since the root is set to my home directory, pyright will have to analyse the entire directory for no reason at all. `script.py` is not even part of any repo. It is meant to be edited in single-file mode. On my system, it took a few seconds for Pyright to even load. \r\n\r\nHere's a video illustrating the workflow I just described. Pyright's root directory is set to neovim's cwd even though the file is meant to be edited in single-file mode.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/assets/69449791/4ab4dc8c-a346-44e5-bb6d-777cadd40e85\r\n\r\n\r\n**Neovim is not VSCode**\r\nHow does one uses VSCode? You launch VSCode, select a working directory from the side panel, and then start editing the files inside the working directory you just selected. But that's not how you use neovim. In neovim, you sometimes want to open files that are outside of neovim's cwd. \r\n\r\nNeovim is not VSCode. They are both different editors designed for different workflows. \r\n\r\n@glepnir \r\nDo I have permission to revert the changes in this PR? I have already tested the plugin without this PR. Pyright's performance issue went away after I removed this PR (duh). ",
