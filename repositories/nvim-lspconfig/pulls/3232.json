This is misleading.\r\n\r\nAs the [README of `typescript-language-server`](https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server/blob/master/README.md) says, it's a wrapper of `tsserver`. This abuse has been around for so many time in lspconfig that people don't realize they are two different things, and are then confused by replacements of `typescript-language-server` like [typescript-tools.nvim](https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim) and [vtsls](https://github.com/yioneko/vtsls).",

Changing the name will not break users' configurations, `lspconfig.tsserver.setup{}` is still valid and will only have a warning that `tsserver` is deprecated suggest using `ts_ls` instead. In fact, we've already done that for `lua_ls`, formerly called `sumneko_lua`, which I think most neovim users will setup no matter what language they are mainly writing. The breaking change should not be that painful.\r\n\r\n2. One of the reasons for creating this PR is to prepare the issue you linked to be resolved. If we do not merge this PR and then merge it after the real `tsserver` implements LSP, the name `tsserver` will refer to a different thing after that. That is, `tsserver` in lspconfig is formerly to be `typescript-language-server`, but then be the real `tsserver`. This will cause the meaning of `lspconfig.tsserver.setup` changed silently, and users' configurations will setup the real `tsserver`, not `typescript-language-server`. It should be very difficult for users to find out what happened.",

Honestly, the naming of these servers in lspconfig is a mess, `foo language server` sometimes be `foo_ls` and sometimes be `foo_language_server`, I prefer a shorter name if we could name it, otherwise choose the `typescript_language_server` to make it the same with the repository name.",
