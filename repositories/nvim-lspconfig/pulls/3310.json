My change is really just a minor fix, not deserving of being a whole new plugin. If there was an option to simply fix the existing config, I would do that, but I tried that and was told that neovim is intended to go the route of VSCode, with separate plugins per language, so that the maintenance burden is only on those who actually know how the language server works - and I can see the point @mjlbach and @justinmk are making on that (see discussion in #1693).\r\n\r\nHowever, I also agree that it's quite messy having these as separate plugins. Just look at [this PR](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/nvim-lspconfig-ada/pull/2) - switching to the new method is going to break for some users as they will need to update nvim-lspconfig to the latest version whenever updating nvim-lspconfig-ada; this problem is going to keep cropping up, because any language server plugins built on top of nvim-lspconfig have a dependency on that version of nvim-lspconfig. For now all I can do is periodically update to the latest version, make sure everything works, and pin that version of nvim-lspconfig in my plugin's readme.\r\n\r\n@justinmk what's your view on this dependency problem and how it should be resolved, in general for nvim-lspconfig-based plugins? If indeed my fix had simply been made in-place, [your later refactoring](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/commit/bedb2a0df105f68a624a49b867f269b6d55a2c89#diff-b335630551682c19a781afebcf4d07bf978fb1f8ac04c6bf87428ed5106870f5R134) would of course have also updated the als plugin.",

Furthermore, I believe I've never encountered this issue because I either use the ALS on projects that have extremely simple project structures (and so the ALS works by default) or projects where there are multiple project files and the one to use cannot be decided by a generic mechanism (I instead hardcoded my choices through scripting).\r\n\r\n>At the moment, since Ada is the only plugin that you're not allowing us to maintain inside nvim-lspconfig\r\n\r\nIt's not a matter of allowing or not allowing a language server in nvim-lspconfig, it's a matter of allowing code vs data declarations. The data declarations of the ALS are fine and allowed.\r\n\r\n>I just hope you're not proposing to include the old and broken als config - that would immediately break things for all users who have installed nvim-lspconfig-ada, as the lsp config name is the same, \"als\".\r\n\r\nIf a runtime path conflict is the only thing to worry about, then I wonder if we could find a way to ensure that `nvim-lspconfig`'s `als.lua` is always found last. If not, the configuration could be re-introduced as `ada_language_server.lua`.\r\n\r\n>How do you know you prefer your scripting solution if you haven't tried mine?\r\n\r\nI prefer my solution because my solution requires less trust.\r\n\r\n>please share your solution\r\n\r\nIt's not very generalizable, basically I do:\r\n```lua\r\nlocal function als_on_init(client)\r\n       local result = nil\r\n       local path = client.workspace_folders[1].uri:sub(8)\r\n       if vim.fn.filereadable(path .. \"/gnat.gpr\") ~= 0 then\r\n               result = path .. \"/gnat.gpr\"\r\n       elseif vim.fn.filereadable(path .. \"/gnat2scil.gpr\") ~= 0 then\r\n               result = path .. \"/gnat2scil.gpr\"\r\n       elseif ... then\r\n          ...\r\n       end\r\n       if result ~= nil then\r\n               client.config.settings.ada = { projectFile = result, log_level = 0 } \r\n               client.notify(\"workspace/didChangeConfiguration\", client.config.settings)\r\n       end\r\n       return true\r\nend\r\nl.ada_language_server.setup{\r\n       on_init = als_on_init;\r\n       settings = {};\r\n}\r\n```",

            "body": "Thanks for sharing. Looks like you are basically hardcoding in your config a set hierarchy of projectfiles, to which you add all the projects you need. This works as long as you only ever need one particular projectfile inside each project - in order to switch projectfiles within one project you need to modify & reload your config, and restart als, which would be tedious. Often Ada projects have many library projects which are never selected, and one main project, in which case indeed you can hardcode it in various ways.\r\n\r\nHowever, you could still consider using [nvim-lsp-gpr-selector](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/nvim-lsp-gpr-selector) instead; it asks you on startup which projectfile to use whenever there is ambiguity, and also allows you to fuzzy search for project files, in case there's many. It then remembers your choice for next time, so it should give you strictly better behaviour than your script. In case there's anything missing in your workflow after switching, please open an issue and it can be fixed.\r\n\r\n[It's 109 lines of lua](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/nvim-lsp-gpr-selector/blob/master/lua/gpr_selector.lua), so if trust is an issue then just review, fork and pin one version of it in your config, e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPlug 'glacambre/nvim-lsp-gpr-selector', { 'branch': 'reviewed_version' }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n> If what @glacambre requested seems reasonable then that is what I'm in favor of.\r\n\r\nIt's not entirely clear to me which version @glacambre is proposing - the *mistake* he points to seems to be that nvim-lspconfig no longer works at all for Ada, and I agree that's not desirable. I also agree with @glacambre that backwards compatibility is important. Hence, I would like those who have made the step to use [nvim-lspconfig-ada](https://github.com/TamaMcGlinn/nvim-lspconfig-ada) to not end up with a broken config after some version is added again in the default nvim-lspconfig.\r\n\r\n> If a runtime path conflict is the only thing to worry about, then I wonder if we could find a way to ensure that nvim-lspconfig's als.lua is always found last. If not, the configuration could be re-introduced as ada_language_server.lua.\r\n\r\nI think changing the filename and also the config name is necessary.",

It's non-obvious and quite fatal to not set it when this is ambiguous. You can't really call it a checkhealth for ALS if it's not allowed to report this setting.\r\n\r\nDoes it become okay if I reduce the code in lspinfo to a one-liner? For example, not searching for a gpr file but just reporting if it was explicitly set? Or is any customization of lspinfo disallowed, such as the 16 lines of code you can find in hls.lua?",
