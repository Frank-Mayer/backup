That's the problem I wanted to solve.\r\n\r\nSo how about this: look for a `mix.exs` file in the `.git` root. If it doesn't exist, look for a `mix.exs` file in the closest ancestor directory?\r\n\r\nEven better would be to look for the closest `mix.exs` file to the `.git` root, to cover the case of an umbrella app in a subdirectory of the repo, but I guess that might be a little trickier?\r\n\r\nTaking this further - why stop at a git repo boundary? Could it be sensible to simply look for the highest ancestor directory containing a `mix.exs`?",
