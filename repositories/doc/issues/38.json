This feature was apparently introduced in neovim 0.9.  0.7.2 was the latest I could get following the instructions for installing on ubuntu from the PPA (the ubuntu-provided one is even older).\r\n\r\nOf course, it's fine to use such a command in documentation aimed at 0.9+ specifically.  But it's less good on a web site when not everyone is up-to-date.  At minimum, you should list a minimum version.  But ideally https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html would work for commonly-used versions.\r\n\r\nIf the PPA and Ubuntu versions are too old to be supported by https://neovim.io/doc/user/nvim.html, then ideally https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim would contain a warning and a recommendation to compile from source.\r\n",
