    "body": "As of https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/pull/2573, the tree-sitter-cli `make install` no longer installs the `parser.h` file to the system. Now, we need to use the relative path instead otherwise it will fail to compile in the fuzzing action. However, the npm install and cargo install both still install the `parser.h` so if the fuzzing action can use npm or cargo to install the tree-sitter that would continue to work but it feels like a temporary bandage solution.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/neovim/tree-sitter-vim/blob/77e9e96c2ae5cff7343ce3dced263483acf95793/src/scanner.c#L3",
