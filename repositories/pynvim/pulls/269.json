            "body": "> This is needed because Range doesn't support partial lines, right?\r\n\r\nAye, exactly this.\r\n\r\n@justinmk \r\nSo simply rename Selection to Region you mean? Would make sense to further abstract from the originally motivating visual selection.\r\n\r\nRegarding the deprecation of Range/merge of Range into Selection/Region: Should this be done immediately in this PR or as a follow-up one?\r\n\r\nA reason against having those two objects merged would be that Range would implement writing through onto the buffer while not caring about partials and Selection/Region takes care of the partial-lines-implementation, separating those logics. But otherwise, merging both into one object would probably reduce the overall footprint.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in case we go for direct merge, I think I might have found a Bug in Range that I'd like to investigate and possibly fix before we would merge the two classes, therefore I would stall this PR for the moment then to keep Bugfixes separate from Feature implementations in that case if that's ok.",

That makes handling of such a selection actually quite different for my taste as both differ in a number of nasty details, requiring very different flavors of `__setitem__` and `__getitem__`.\r\n\r\nMerging both into one Class and having a switch would be an option, though. I'm not yet sure if that's a nice solution, because `__getitem__` and `__setitem__` work very differently and also `len()` can be well defined for a normal selection (as the number of characters) whereas this is very much less obvious for a block-region.\r\n\r\nThis then make up more or less the entirety of that class (as `__init__` is also different (at least how I implement it) for both due to the slightly different requirements outlined above), therefore it might be advisable to have to classes for that to not also make the code harder to read by such an inline-switch-case.\r\n\r\n(I dropped the \"let's inherit from a general object\"-idea, though, as that does indeed make very little sense in this context.)\r\n\r\nAt least this is my reasoning to this point as far as I have thought the thing out so far. I'm happy to be convinced otherwise, @justinmk :) Wouldn't be the first time that I don't see a more beautiful solution right away and go for a very much inferior one.^^\r\n\r\n(and don't mind the failing CI, btw., I just pushed the current state for brief review, I will fix and test ASAP. However, feel free to comment on the current code right now (at least on a conceptual level), if you want, that's why I already pushed even if it's not yet finished).",
