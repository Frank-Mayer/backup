Pipe (subprocess) based pynvim was broken since neovim 0.5.0, probably due to https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/c86d5fa981b0651167f789aaff685b42cad7aaca (neovim/neovim#11390): on Windows, stderr is closed for an embedded nvim.\r\n\r\nSee the commit message for more details.\r\n\r\n## fix: do not leak resources across tests so as to prevent side effects\r\n\r\nSee the commit message for more details. asyncio event loops were not closing properly during tests, and were leaking in subsequent EventLoop, Session, Nvim instances.",

Indeed, there are a few places where transports are leaking, which I already fixed in my working branches with a major refactoring on `AsyncioEventLoop` but didn't include in this PR because I didn't want to make this PR too big to review easily.
