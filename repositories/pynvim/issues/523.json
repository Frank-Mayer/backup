            "body": "Thinking more about, I guess the #506 PR is not compliant with the `vim.eval` [documentation](https://neovim.io/doc/user/if_pyth.html#python-eval). \r\n\r\nThe documentation states\r\n\r\n> vim.eval(str)\t\t\t\t\t\tpython-eval\r\n\tEvaluates the expression str using the vim internal expression\r\n\tevaluator (see [expression](https://neovim.io/doc/user/eval.html#expression)).  Returns the expression result as:\r\n(1) a string if the Vim expression evaluates to a string or number\r\n(2) a list if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim list\r\n(3) a dictionary if the Vim expression evaluates to a Vim dictionary Dictionaries and lists are recursively expanded. \r\n\r\nIn Python, booleans are implemented as a [subclass of integers](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bool.html#:~:text=Booleans%20in%20Python%20are%20implemented%20as%20a%20subclass%20of%20integers.).\r\nIn nvim, `v:true` and `v:false` evalutes to `true` and `false` (boolean values); for boolean values [vim uses numbers](https://neovim.io/doc/user/eval.html#Boolean).\r\nTherefore, by (1) and that booleans are integers in Python, `vim.eval('v:true')` should evaluate to the Python string `\"True\"` and not the boolean `True`.\r\nAnd therefore `:py3 print(type(vim.eval('v:true')))` should print out `<class 'str'>` and not `<class 'bool'>`.\r\nThus, the extra check in #506 is redundant, right?\r\n",
