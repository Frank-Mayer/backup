    "body": "# Problem\r\n\r\nThe design, and usage, of remote plugins can be simplified, as described in https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/27949 \r\n\r\ntl;dr:\r\n\r\n- remove the concept of \"remote plugins\"\r\n- instead, any python module that imports `pynvim` can call `set_handler('foo', myFunction)` to handle the \"foo\" request from Nvim\r\n- \"remote plugins\" become plain old Lua plugins which call RPC methods on the python module\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\n- Apply the above proposal to pynvim. \r\n- Deprecate the old rplugin interface.\r\n- Provide a migration script or documentation for old rplugins.\r\n\r\n# Reference\r\n\r\nImplementation in node-client: https://github.com/neovim/node-client/pull/344\r\n\r\nRelated work here (this Nvim RPC application does not use rplugins, it sets up its own RPC methods which can be called from the Nvim peer): https://github.com/b0o/blender.nvim/blob/eb495c3d7217efb4bdec4e50d1f9be1372d33e2c/blender_nvim/rpc.py#L115-L127\r\n\r\n> Since I'm attaching to neovim from an external python program, not as an rplugin, pynvim doesn't start its event loop by default. So I'm spawning a new thread, and starting pynvim's event loop on it. I'm also registering request/notification handlers which I call when pynvim receives RPC messages from neovim. I'm using an \"executor\" to run the registered callbacks on the main thread. It's working great.",
